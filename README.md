> `Error: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.`

Java is not located in your PATH, either source the right `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc. file or do the following command in this repository:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' > .bash_profile && source .bash_profile
```
