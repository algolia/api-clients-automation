title: Custom helpers
---

The API clients provide many hand-written helpers for tasks that would otherwise require custom code or global knowledge of how the Algolia API works.

## Complex usage descrpition

:::info

This section explains the decision over the implementation of complicated helper, self-explanatory ones might not be listed.

:::


### `replaceAllObjects`

:::caution

Always wait on the tmp index, because:

- it's the only index that we know for sure will exist (since we create it).
- it is Metis compliant, no need for custom implementation.

:::

#### 1. copy index

The first step is to make a copy of the index settings, rules and synonyms.

We **don't wait** for this first operation, as we:

- don't know if the source index exists, and therefore can't call `waitTask` on it.
- won't have a tmp index to `waitTask` on, if the `copy` can't succeed.

#### 2. chunk batch

Call the chunk batch for the given `objects`, call `waitTask` for the batching operation, which would create the `tmp` index in case `copy` did not succeded.

#### 3. copy index again

Now that we are certain the tmp index exist:

1. `waitTask` on the tmp index, with the `taskID` returned from the first copy index invocation.
2. call `copy` again, if the first call succeeded, it will be a noop, otherwise, the tmp index will be rebuilt.
3. `waitTask` on the tmp index

#### 4. move tmp index

Move the tmp index to the source index, call `waitTask` on the tmp index.
