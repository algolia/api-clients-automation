In Algolia, you can delete multiple objects efficiently using the batch functionality. This guide will show you how to delete multiple objects at once.

## Delete Multiple Objects

To delete multiple objects using batch, create a *batch write params*  object that contains the array of delete requests.
Each delete request should have the `action` set to `deleteObject` and the `body` containing the respective object ID.
This allows you to define multiple delete operations within the `requests` array.

<CodeBlockLanguage snippet={({getSnippet, waitForTaskSnippet}) => (
`${getSnippet('import')}

${getSnippet('init')}

${getSnippet('batch', 'deleteObject')}

${waitForTaskSnippet()}
`)}/>

By executing the above code, all the objects with the specified object IDs will be deleted from your index.

That's it! You have successfully deleted multiple objects using `batch`.
