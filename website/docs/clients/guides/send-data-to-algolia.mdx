title: Send data to Algolia
---

import { CodeBlockLanguage } from '../../../src/components/CodeBlockLanguage';

Algolia doesn’t search directly into your own data source. For data to be searchable, you need to send it to Algolia’s servers.

This happens right after retrieving your data from your data source and reformatting it. Once your data is ready, you can push it to Algolia using the `batch` method.

## Sending your data

:::caution

If the data you are sending is more than 1000 records at once, we recommend you to use [our chunked batch solution](/docs/clients/guides/filtering-your-search) instead.

:::

Before sending anything to Algolia, you need to retrieve your data. You can do this in several ways, in our case we will pick it from the source code directly.

<CodeBlockLanguage snippet={({getSnippet, waitForTaskSnippet}) => (
`${getSnippet('import')}

${getSnippet('init')}

${getSnippet('batch', 'addObject')}

${waitForTaskSnippet()}
`)}/>
