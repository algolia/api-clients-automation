> The `waitForTask` method is only available in the `search` client context.

Some operations related to the Algolia index are not always instantaneous. Doing such operations with our API clients will provide a `taskID` in the response body, so you can later know what is the status of your operation.

We provide a `waitForTask` helper method for you to easily wait for a specific task status.

<CodeBlockLanguage snippet={({getSnippet, waitForTaskSnippet}) => (
`${getSnippet('import')}

${getSnippet('init')}

${getSnippet('deleteObject')}

${waitForTaskSnippet()}
`)}/>
