title: Filtering your search
---

import { CodeBlockLanguage } from '../../../src/components/CodeBlockLanguage';

Filtering is primarily used in the context of front-end search. We call this faceting, where filters are displayed on the search UI as clickable items, allowing users to select one or more filters. This enables a more refined, drilled-down search experience.

## How to Filter Your Data

### 1. Define attributes that need to be filterable (at indexing time)

Initially, filter attributes must be defined as facets, using the `attributesForFaceting` parameter. This can be done using the `setSettings` method.

<CodeBlockLanguage snippet={({getSnippet, waitForTaskSnippet}) => (
`${getSnippet('import')}

${getSnippet('init')}

${getSnippet('setSettings', 'setSettingsAttributesForFaceting')}

${waitForTaskSnippet()}
`)}/>

### 2. Filter by Attributes (at query time)

The actual filtering of records is performed at query time, not at indexing time. For this, you need to use the filters parameter in your search code.

#### Filtering by string using the `filters` field

<CodeBlockLanguage snippet={({addComment, getSnippet}) => (
`${addComment('Only "Scarlett Johansson" actor')}
${getSnippet('search', 'filterOnly')}

${addComment('Only "Tom Cruise" or "Scarlett Johansson" actor')}
${getSnippet('search', 'filterOr')}

${addComment('Everything but "Nicolas Cage" actor')}
${getSnippet('search', 'filterNot')}
`)}/>
