import { CodeBlockLanguage } from '../../../src/components/CodeBlockLanguage';

In Algolia, you can replace all existing rules and synonyms by leveraging the appropriate methods. This guide will show you how to use `saveRules` and `saveSynonyms` methods to achieve this.

## Replace All Rules

To replace all existing rules in Algolia, you can use the `saveRules` method with the `clearExistingRules` parameter set to `true`.

<CodeBlockLanguage snippet={({getSnippet, waitForTaskSnippet}) => (
`${getSnippet('import')}

${getSnippet('init')}

${getSnippet('saveRules')}

${waitForTaskSnippet()}
`)}/>

The rules parameter should contain the array of rules you want to save.
By executing the above code, all existing rules will be removed, and the new rules provided will be saved to your Algolia index.

## Replace All Synonyms

To replace all existing synonyms in Algolia, you can use the `saveSynonyms` method with the `replaceExistingSynonyms` parameter set to `true`.

<CodeBlockLanguage snippet={({getSnippet, waitForTaskSnippet}) => (
`${getSnippet('saveSynonyms')}

${waitForTaskSnippet()}
`)}/>
The `synonymHit`parameter should contain the synonyms you want to save.
By executing the above code, all existing synonyms will be replaced with the new synonyms provided.

That's it! You have learned how to replace all existing rules and synonyms in Algolia using the `saveRules` and `saveSynonyms` methods respectively.
