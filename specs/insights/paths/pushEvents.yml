    Send a list of events to the Insights API.

    You can include up to 1,000 events in a single request,
    but the request body must be smaller than 2MB.

                List of click and conversion events.

                An event is an object representing a user interaction.
                Events have attributes that describe the interaction,
                such as an event name, a type, or a user token.
                Some attributes require other attributes to be declared,
                and some attributes can't be declared at the same time.

                **All** events must be valid or the API returns an error.

                      Can contain up to 64 ASCII characters. 

                      Consider naming events consistentlyâ€”for example,
                      by adopting Segment's
                      [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework)
                      framework.
                    example: Product Clicked
                  index:
                    title: index name
                    type: string
                    description: Name of the Algolia index.
                    example: YourIndexName
                  userToken:
                    title: user token
                    type: string
                    minLength: 1
                    maxLength: 128
                    pattern: '[a-zA-Z0-9_=/+-]{1,128}'
                    description:  |
                      Anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier. 

                      > **Note**: Never include personally identifiable information in user tokens.
                    example: test-user-1
                  timestamp:
                    title: timestamp
                    type: integer

                      Time of the event in milliseconds in [Unix epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
                      By default, the Insights API uses the time it receives an event as its timestamp.
                    example: 1687193127
                  queryID:
                    title: query ID
                    type: string
                    pattern: '[0-9a-f]{32}'
                    minLength: 32
                    maxLength: 32

                      Unique identifier for a search query.

                      The query ID is required for events related to search or browse requests.
                      If you add `clickAnalytics: true` as a search request parameter, the query ID is included in the API response.

                      Position of the clicked objects in the search results.

                      The first search result has a position of 1 (not 0).
                      You must provide 1 `position` for each `objectID`.
                    example: [1, 2, 5]
                required:
                  - eventName
