eventName:
  type: string
  minLength: 1
  maxLength: 64
  pattern: '[\x20-\x7E]{1,64}'
  description: |
    Event name, up to 64 ASCII characters.

    Consider naming events consistently—for example, by adopting Segment's
    [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework)
    framework.

index:
  type: string
  description: Index name (case-sensitive) to which the event's items belong.
  example: ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME

userToken:
  type: string
  minLength: 1
  maxLength: 129
  pattern: '[a-zA-Z0-9_=/+-]{1,129}'
  description: |
    Anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier.

    Don't use personally identifiable information in user tokens.
    For more information, see [User token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
  example: test-user-1

authenticatedUserToken:
  type: string
  minLength: 1
  maxLength: 129
  pattern: '[a-zA-Z0-9_=/+-]{1,129}'
  description: |
    Identifier for authenticated users.

    When the user signs in, you can get an identifier from your system and send it as `authenticatedUserToken`.
    This lets you keep using the `userToken` from before the user signed in, while providing a reliable way to identify users across sessions.
    Don't use personally identifiable information in user tokens.
    For more information, see [User token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
  example: c6a52c02-d0c7-4b53-8ce3-2b8fd202f3f9

timestamp:
  type: integer
  format: int64
  description: |
    Timestamp of the event, measured in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
    By default, the Insights API uses the time it receives an event as its timestamp.
  example: 1687193127

queryID:
  type: string
  pattern: '[0-9a-f]{32}'
  minLength: 32
  maxLength: 32
  description: |
    Unique identifier for a search query.

    The query ID is required for events related to search or browse requests.
    If you add `clickAnalytics: true` as a search request parameter, the query ID is included in the API response.

objectIDs:
  type: array
  description: Object IDs of the records that are part of the event.
