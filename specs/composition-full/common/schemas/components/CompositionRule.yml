        Query pattern that triggers the rule.

        You can use either a literal string, or a special pattern `{facet:ATTRIBUTE}`, where `ATTRIBUTE` is a facet name.
        The rule is triggered if the query matches the literal string or a value of the specified facet.
        For example, with `pattern: {facet:genre}`, the rule is triggered when users search for a genre, such as "comedy".
      example: '{facet:genre}'

        Filters that trigger the rule.

        You can add add filters using the syntax `facet:value` so that the rule is triggered, when the specific filter is selected.
        You can use `filters` on its own or combine it with the `pattern` parameter.
      example: 'genre:comedy'

    Which part of the search query the pattern should match:

    - `startsWith`. The pattern must match the beginning of the query.
    - `endsWith`. The pattern must match the end of the query.
    - `is`. The pattern must match the query exactly.
    - `contains`. The pattern must match anywhere in the query.

    Empty queries are only allowed as patterns with `anchoring: is`.
  enum: [is, startsWith, endsWith, contains]
