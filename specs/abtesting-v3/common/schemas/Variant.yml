    A/B test variants.

    The first variant is your _control_ index, typically your production index.
    All of the additional variants are indexes with changed settings that you want to test against the control.

        Estimated number of searches required to achieve the desired statistical significance.

        The A/B test configuration must include a `mininmumDetectableEffect` setting for this number to be included in the response.

        Only present in case the metric is 'revenue'. 
        It is the amount exceeding the 95th percentile of global revenue transactions involved in the AB Test. This amount is not considered when calculating statistical significance.
        It is tied to a per revenue-currency pair contrary to other 
        global filter effects (such as outliers and empty search count).
