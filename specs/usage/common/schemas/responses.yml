                    Depending on the statistic, the type of this value (`v`) differs.
                    Most statistics return integer values.

                    `degraded_queries_*`, `max_qps`, and `used_search_capacity` are returned as maps of server name strings to integers.

                    `region_*` statistics return strings (regions).
