        Filters to promote or demote records in the search results.

        Optional filters work like facet filters, but they don't exclude records from the search results.
        Records that match the optional filter rank before records that don't match.
        Matches with higher weights (`<score=N>`) rank before matches with lower weights.
        If you're using a negative filter `facet:-value`, matching records rank after records that don't match.

      example:
        - 'category:books<score=1>'
