    Create or update a batch of Recommend Rules

    Each Recommend Rule is created or updated, depending on whether a Recommend Rule with the same `objectID` already exists.
    You may also specify `true` for `clearExistingRules`, in which case the batch will atomically replace all the existing Recommend Rules.

    Recommend Rules are similar to Search Rules, except that the conditions and consequences apply to a [source item](/doc/guides/algolia-recommend/overview/#recommend-models) instead of a query. The main differences are the following:
    - Conditions `pattern` and `anchoring` are unavailable.
    - Condition `filters` triggers if the source item matches the specified filters.
    - Condition `filters` accepts numeric filters.
    - Consequence `params` only covers filtering parameters.
    - Consequence `automaticFacetFilters` doesn't require a facet value placeholder (it tries to match the data source item's attributes instead).
