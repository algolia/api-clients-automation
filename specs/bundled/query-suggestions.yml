  description: >
    The Query Suggestions API lets you manage your Query Suggestions
    configurations.

    Query Suggestions add new indices to your Algolia application with popular
    search queries, external suggestions, or facet values.

    In your user interface, you can query the Query Suggestions indices like
    regular indices and add [suggested
    searches](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/query-suggestions/js)
    to guide users and speed up their search.


    ## Base URLs


    The base URLs for requests to the Query Suggestions API are:


    - `https://query-suggestions.us.algolia.com`

    - `https://query-suggestions.eu.algolia.com`


    Use the URL that matches your [analytics
    region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics).


    **All requests must use HTTPS.**


    ## Authentication


    To authenticate your API requests, add these headers:


    - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID.

    - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the
    request.
      The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference.

    You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
    dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account).


    ## Request format


    Request bodies must be JSON objects.


    ## Response status and errors


    Response bodies are JSON objects.

    Deleting a user token returns an empty response body with rate-limiting
    information as headers.


    Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx`
    status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.

    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.


    ## Version


    The current version of the Query Suggestions API is version 1, as indicated
    by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: https://query-suggestions.{region}.algolia.com
    description: >
      You can check the region for your application in the [Algolia
      dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics).

      If you connect to the wrong region, the API returns an error with the
      status `401` and the message: "The log processing region does not match".

        Deleting only removes the configuration and stops updates to the Query
        Suggestions index.

        To delete the Query Suggestions index itself, use the Search API and the
        `Delete an index` operation.

        such as "blue adidas", "red adidas", "blue nike", "red nike", etc.

        Algolia indices with popular searches to use as query suggestions.


        Records of these indices must have these attributes:


        - `query`: search query which will be added as a suggestion

        - `count`: measure of popularity of that search query


        For example, you can export popular searches from an external analytics
        provider, such as Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics,

        and feed this data into an Algolia index.

        You can use this index to generate query suggestions until your Algolia
        Analytics has collected enough data.
