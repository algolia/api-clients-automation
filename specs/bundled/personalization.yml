  description: >
    The Personalization API lets you access user profiles built from the
    personalization strategy.


    ## Base URLs


    The base URLs for requests to the Personalization API are:


    - `https://personalization.us.algolia.com`

    - `https://personalization.eu.algolia.com`


    Use the URL that matches your [analytics
    region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics).


    **All requests must use HTTPS.**


    ## Authentication


    To authenticate your API requests, add these headers:


    - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID.

    - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the
    request.
      The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference.

    You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
    dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account).


    ## Request format


    Request bodies must be JSON objects.


    ## Response status and errors


    The Personalization API returns JSON responses.

    Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order
    of attributes in the API response.


    Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx`
    status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.

    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.


    ## Rate limiting


    When making requests to the Personalization API, you are limited to 40 API
    calls per second per application.


    The following headers provide information about your current limit:


    - `x-ratelimit-limit`: The number of requests allowed every second.

    - `x-ratelimit-remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current

    second period.

    - `x-ratelimit-reset`: [Unix timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com) of

    the next time period.


    ## Version


    The current version of the Personalization API is version 1, as indicated by
    the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.

      User profiles represent the affinities each user profile has for the
      different facets in your index.

      The more a user viewed and clicked search results with a specific facet,

      the higher the affinity for that facet.

      The personalization strategy defines how personalization should affect the
      search results,

      and how much each facet and event type impact the personalization.
