  summary: >-
    The Insights API lets you collect events related to your search and
    discovery experience
  description: >
    Events represent user interactions with your app or website.

    They unlock powerful features, such as recommendations, personalization,
    smarter search results,

    and analytics that help you optimize your user experience.


    ## Client libraries


    Use Algolia's API clients, libraries, and integrations to collect events
    from your UI and send them to the Insights API.

    For more information, see [Algolia's
    ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem).


    ## Base URLs


    The base URLs for making requests to the Insights API are:


    - `https://insights.us.algolia.io`

    - `https://insights.de.algolia.io`

    - `https//insights.algolia.io` (routes requests to the closest of the above
    servers, based on your geographical location)


    **All requests must use HTTPS.**


    ## Authentication


    Add these headers to authenticate requests:


    - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID.

    - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the
    request.
      The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference.

    You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
    dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys).


    ## Request format


    Request bodies must be JSON objects.


    ## Response status and errors


    Response bodies are JSON objects.

    Deleting a user token returns an empty response body with rate-limiting
    information as headers.


    Successful responses return `2xx` statuses. Client errors return `4xx`
    statuses. Server errors return `5xx` statuses.

    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.


    The Insights API doesn't validate if the event parameters such as
    `indexName`, `objectIDs`, or `userToken`,

    correspond to anything in the Search API. It just checks if they're
    formatted correctly.

    Check the [Events](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events/health) health
    section,

    whether your events can be used for Algolia features such as Analytics, or
    Dynamic Re-Ranking.

                    Success indicates that the Insights API received the events
                    correctly, and that event properties are formatted
                    correctly. Success doesn't imply that the event can be used
                    by any Algolia feature. For example, the Insights API
                    doesn't check if the index name you provided exists, or if
                    the object IDs exist in your index.

        Consider naming events consistently—for example, by adopting Segment's

        [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework)

        framework.

      example: ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME

      description: Object IDs of the records that are part of the event.
      items:
        type: string

      example:

      description: |
        Position of the clicked item the search results.

        You must provide 1 `position` for each `objectID`.
      example:
        - 1
        - 2
        - 5

        Unique identifier for a search query.


        The query ID is required for events related to search or browse
        requests.

        If you add `clickAnalytics: true` as a search request parameter, the
        query ID is included in the API response.

        Identifier for authenticated users.


        When the user signs in, you can get an identifier from your system and
        send it as `authenticatedUserToken`.

        This lets you keep using the `userToken` from before the user signed in,
        while providing a reliable way to identify users across sessions.

        Don't use personally identifiable information in user tokens.

        For more information, see [User
        token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
