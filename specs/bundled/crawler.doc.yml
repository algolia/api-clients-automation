  description: >
    The Crawler API lets you manage and run your crawlers.


    ## Base URL


    The base URL for making requests to the Crawler API is:


    - `https://crawler.algolia.com/api`


    **All requests must use HTTPS.**


    ## Availability and authentication


    Access to the Crawler API is available with the [Crawler
    add-on](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/).


    To authenticate your API requests, use the **basic authentication** header:


    - `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`


    where `<credentials>` is a base64-encoded string `<user-id>:<api-key>`.


    - `<user-id>`. The Crawler user ID.

    - `<api-key>`. The Crawler API key.


    You can find both in the [Crawler
    dashboard](https://crawler.algolia.com/admin/settings/).

    The Crawler dashboard and API key are different from the regular Algolia
    dashboard and API keys.


    ## Request format


    Request bodies must be JSON objects.


    ## Parameters


    Parameters are passed as query parameters for GET requests,

    and in the request body for POST and PATCH requests.


    Query parameters must be
    [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding).

    Non-ASCII characters must be UTF-8 encoded.


    ## Response status and errors


    The Crawler API returns JSON responses.

    Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order
    of attributes in the API response.


    Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx`
    status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.

    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.


    ## Version


    The current version of the Crawler API is version 1, as indicated by the
    `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  version: 1.0.0

      Actions change the state of crawlers, such as pausing and unpausing crawl

    x-displayName: Configuration
    description: >
      In the Crawler configuration, you specify which URLs to crawl, when to
      crawl, how to extract records from the crawl, and where to index the
      extracted records.

      The configuration is versioned, so you can always restore a previous
      version.

      It's easiest to make configuration changes in the [Crawler
      dashboard](https://crawler.algolia.com/admin/).

      The editor has autocomplete and built-in validation so you can try your
      configuration changes before committing them.

        Use this endpoint to update the crawler's name.

        While you can use this endpoint to completely replace the crawler's
        configuration,

        you should [update the crawler
        configuration](#tag/config/operation/patchConfig) instead.


        If you replace the configuration, you must provide the full
        configuration,

        including the settings you want to keep.

        Configuration changes from this endpoint aren't
        [versioned](#tag/config/operation/listConfigVersions).

      description: >
        Whether the crawler should cache crawled pages.


        With caching, the crawler only crawls changed pages.

        To detect changed pages, the crawler makes [HTTP conditional
        requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests)
        to your pages.

        The crawler uses the `ETag` and `Last-Modified` response headers
        returned by your web server during the previous crawl.

        The crawler sends this information in the `If-None-Match` and
        `If-Modified-Since` request headers.


        If your web server responds with `304 Not Modified` to the conditional
        request, the crawler reuses the records from the previous crawl.


        Caching is ignored in these cases:


        - If your crawler configuration changed between two crawls.

        - If `externalData` changed between two crawls.

            Non-HTML documents are first converted to HTML by an [Apache

            Crawling non-HTML documents has the following limitations:


            - It's slower than crawling HTML documents.

            - PDFs must include the used fonts.

            - The produced HTML pages might not be semantic. This makes
            achieving good relevance more difficult.

            - Natural language detection isn't supported.

            - Extracted metadata might vary between files produced by different
            programs and versions.

            Attributes used for
            [faceting](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/).


            Facets are attributes that let you categorize search results.

            They can be used for filtering search results.

            By default, no attribute is used for faceting.

            Attribute names are case-sensitive.


            **Modifiers**


            - `filterOnly("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Allows the attribute to be used as a filter but doesn't evaluate the facet values.

            - `searchable("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Allows searching for facet values.

            - `afterDistinct("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Evaluates the facet count _after_ deduplication with `distinct`.
              This ensures accurate facet counts.
              You can apply this modifier to searchable facets: `afterDistinct(searchable(ATTRIBUTE))`.

            Replicas are copies of a primary index with the same records but
            different settings, synonyms, or rules.

            If you want to offer a different ranking or sorting of your search
            results, you'll use replica indices.

            All index operations on a primary index are automatically forwarded
            to its replicas.

            To add a replica index, you must provide the complete set of
            replicas to this parameter.

            If you omit a replica from this list, the replica turns into a
            regular, standalone index that will no longer be synced with the
            primary index.


            **Modifier**


            - `virtual("REPLICA")`.
              Create a virtual replica,
              Virtual replicas don't increase the number of records and are optimized for [Relevant sorting](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/in-depth/relevant-sort/).

            (decompounding).

            Attribute names are case-sensitive.


            Compound words are formed by combining two or more individual words,

            and are particularly prevalent in Germanic languages—for example,
            "firefighter".

            With decompounding, the individual components are indexed
            separately.


            You can specify different lists for different languages.

            Decompounding is supported for these languages:

            Dutch (`nl`), German (`de`), Finnish (`fi`), Danish (`da`), Swedish
            (`sv`), and Norwegian (`no`).

            Decompounding doesn't work for words with [non-spacing mark Unicode
            characters](https://www.charactercodes.net/category/non-spacing_mark).

            For example, `Gartenstühle` won't be decompounded if the `ü`
            consists of `u` (U+0075) and `◌̈` (U+0308).

            By default, all numeric attributes are available as numerical

            For faster indexing, reduce the number of numeric attributes.


            To turn off filtering for all numeric attributes, specify an

            like hyphen (`-`), plus (`+`), and parentheses (`(`,`)`).

            To include such characters, define them with `separatorsToIndex`.


            Separators are all non-letter characters except spaces and currency
            characters, such as $€£¥.


            With `separatorsToIndex`, Algolia treats separator characters as
            separate words.

            For example, in a search for "Disney+", Algolia considers "Disney"
            and "+" as two separate words.

            ranking criterion is turned off.

            With a non-empty list, Algolia only returns results with matches in
            the selected attributes.

            In addition, the Attribute ranking criterion is turned on: matches
            in attributes that are higher in the list of `searchableAttributes`
            rank first.

            To make matches in two attributes rank equally, include them in a
            comma-separated string, such as `"title,alternate_title"`.

            Attributes with the same priority are always unordered.

            - `unordered("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Ignore the position of a match within the attribute.

            Without a modifier, matches at the beginning of an attribute rank

            All records with the same value for this attribute are considered a
            group.

            You can combine `attributeForDistinct` with the `distinct` search
            parameter to control

            how many items per group are included in the search results.


            If you want to use the same attribute also for faceting, use the
            `afterDistinct` modifier of the `attributesForFaceting` setting.

            This applies faceting _after_ deduplication, which will result in
            accurate facet counts.

        Removes stop words from the search query.


        Stop words are common words like articles, conjunctions, prepositions,
        or pronouns that have little or no meaning on their own.

        In English, "the", "a", or "and" are stop words.

        By default, only the last query word is treated as a prefix
        (`prefixLast`).

        To turn off prefix search, use `prefixNone`.

        Avoid `prefixAll`, which treats all query words as prefixes.

        This might lead to counterintuitive results and makes your search
        slower.

            This setting sets a default list of languages used by the
            `removeStopWords` and `ignorePlurals` settings.

            This setting also sets a dictionary for word detection in the

            languages.

            To support this, you must place the CJK language **first**.


            **You should always specify a query language.**

            If you don't specify an indexing language, the search engine uses
            all [supported

            Words that should be considered optional when found in the query.


            By default, records must match all words in the search query to be
            included in the search results.

            Adding optional words can help to increase the number of search
            results by running an additional search query that doesn't include
            the optional words.

            For example, if the search query is "action video" and "video" is an
            optional word,

            the search engine runs two queries. One for "action video" and one
            for "action".

            Records that match all words are ranked higher.


            For a search query with 4 or more words **and** all its words are
            optional,

            the number of matched words required for a record to be included in
            the search results increases for every 1,000 records:


            - If `optionalWords` has less than 10 words, the required number of
            matched words increases by 1:
              results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 2 matched words.
            - If `optionalWords` has 10 or more words, the number of required
            matched words increases by the number of optional words divided by 5
            (rounded down).
              For example, with 18 optional words: results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 4 matched words.

            For more information, see [Optional
            words](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/empty-or-insufficient-results/#creating-a-list-of-optional-words).

            This can be useful for attributes with long values, where the

            Turning off the Exact ranking criterion for these attributes favors

            By default, Algolia treats singular and plural forms of a word, and

            - `ignorePlurals`.
              Plurals and similar declensions added by the `ignorePlurals` setting are considered exact matches.

            - `singleWordSynonym`.
              Single-word synonyms, such as "NY" = "NYC", are considered exact matches.

            - `multiWordsSynonym`.
              Multi-word synonyms, such as "NY" = "New York", are considered exact matches.
