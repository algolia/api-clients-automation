  summary: Pushes records through the Pipeline, directly to an index
  description: >
    Pushes records through the Pipeline, directly to an index. You can make the call synchronous by providing the `watch` parameter,
    for asynchronous calls, you can use the observability endpoints and/or debugger dashboard to see the status of your task.

    This method is similar to `push`, but requires a `taskID` instead of a `indexName`, which is useful when many `destinations` target the same `indexName`.
  operationId: pushTask
  x-acl:
    - addObject
    - deleteIndex
    - editSettings

    connect: 180000
    read: 180000
    write: 180000

    - $ref: '../../../common/parameters.yml#/pathTaskID'
