  summary: Push records by indexName
  description: >
    Pushes records through the Pipeline, directly to an index. You can make the call synchronous by providing the `watch` parameter,
    for asynchronous calls, you can use the observability endpoints and/or debugger dashboard to see the status of your task.

    If you want to leverage the [pre-indexing data transformation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/how-to/transform-your-data/), this is the recommended way of ingesting your records.

    This method is similar to `pushTask`, but requires an `indexName` instead of a `taskID`. If zero or many tasks are found,
    an error will be returned.
  operationId: push

    - addObject
    - deleteIndex

    write: 180000
