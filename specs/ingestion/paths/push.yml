  summary: Pushes records through the Pipeline, directly to an index
  description: >
    Pushes records through the Pipeline, directly to an index. You can make the call synchronous by providing the `watch` parameter,
    for asynchronous calls, you can use the observability endpoints and/or debugger dashboard to see the status of your task.

    This method is similar to `pushTask`, but requires an `indexName` instead of a `taskID`. If zero or many tasks are found,
    an error will be returned.
