    summary: Wait for operation to complete
    description: |
      Wait for a task to complete to ensure synchronized composition updates.

      All Algolia write operations are asynchronous. When you make a request for a write operation, for example, to upsert or delete a composition, Algolia creates a task on a queue and returns a taskID. The task itself runs separately, depending on the server load.
