External:

    Algolia indices with popular searches to use as query suggestions.

    Records of these indices must have these attributes:

    - `query`: search query which will be added as a suggestion
    - `count`: measure of popularity of that search query

    For example, you can export popular searches from an external analytics provider, such as Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics,
    and feed this data into an Algolia index.
    You can use this index to generate query suggestions until your Algolia Analytics has collected enough data.
