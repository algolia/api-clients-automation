    Get predictions, properties (raw, computed or custom) and segments (computed or custom) for an authenticated user (userID) or an anonymous user (cookieID).

    The predictions can be goals, metrics or affinities: 
    * **Goals** ML models compute the probability for an action. Ex. A funnel stage model can output the next stage in the user conversion funnel - add_to_cart with a probability of 72%.
    * **Metrics** ML models output a number. Ex. Next order value is 172.43 USD. Since metrics models are usually based on regression, these predictions have a single value without a probability attached to it.
    * **Affinities** ML models output a set of item attributes with associated probabilities. Ex. a user is interested in items with the following characteristics: *color: red* (56% probability), *brand: Adidas* (67% probability).

    The usage of segments for a user profile assumes that actions are implemented in a website or app and can be triggered when a segment is identified: *if segment1 in user_segments then do action*. For example, a segment can represent users that are close to churning and the action can be offering them an incentive such as a discount code or free shipping.
