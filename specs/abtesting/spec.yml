  description: |
    The Algolia A/B Testing API lets you manage your Algolia A/B tests to optimize your search experience.

    ## Base URLs

    The base URLs for requests to the A/B testing API are:

    - `https://analytics.us.algolia.com`
    - `https://analytics.de.algolia.com`
    - `https://analytics.algolia.com` (routes requests to the closest of the above servers, based on your geographical location)

    Use the URL that matches your [analytics region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics).

    **All requests must use HTTPS.**

    ## Availability and authentication

    Access to the A/B testing API is available as part of the [Premium or Elevate plans](https://www.algolia.com/pricing).

    To authenticate your API requests, add these headers:

    - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID.
    - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request.
      The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference.

    You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account).

    ## Rate limits

    You can make up to **100 requests per minute per app** to the A/B testing API.
    The response includes headers with information about the limits.

    ## Parameters

    Query parameters must be [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding).
    Non-ASCII characters must be UTF-8 encoded.
    Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces.

    ## Response status and errors

    The A/B testing API returns JSON responses.
    Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response.

    Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.
    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.

    The current version of the A/B Testing API is version 2, as indicated by the `/2/` in each endpoint's URL.
