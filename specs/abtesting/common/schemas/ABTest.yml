Status:

    A/B test status.

    - `active`. The A/B test is live and search traffic is split between the two variants.
    - `stopped`. You stopped the A/B test. The A/B test data is still available for analysis.
    - `expired`. The A/B test was automatically stopped after reaching its end date.
    - `failed`. Creating the A/B test failed.
