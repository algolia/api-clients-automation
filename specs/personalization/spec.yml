    The Personalization API lets you access user profiles built from the personalization strategy.

    ## Base URLs

    The base URLs for requests to the Personalization API are:

    - `https://personalization.us.algolia.com`
    - `https://personalization.eu.algolia.com`

    Use the URL that matches your [analytics region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics).

    **All requests must use HTTPS.**

    ## Authentication

    To authenticate your API requests, add these headers:

    - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID.
    - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request.
      The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference.

    You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account).

    ## Request format

    Request bodies must be JSON objects.

    ## Response status and errors

    The Personalization API returns JSON responses.
    Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response.

    Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.
    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.

    ## Version

    The current version of the Personalization API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  version: 1.0.0
