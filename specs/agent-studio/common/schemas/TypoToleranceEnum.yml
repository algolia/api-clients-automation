  title: typoToleranceEnum
  description: '- `min`. Return matches with the lowest number of typos.   For example,
    if you have matches without typos, only include those.   But if there are no matches
    without typos (with 1 typo), include matches with 1 typo (2 typos). - `strict`.
    Return matches with the two lowest numbers of typos.   With `strict`, the Typo
    ranking criterion is applied first in the `ranking` setting.'
