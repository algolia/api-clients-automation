  summary: Retrieve purchase rate
  description: |
    Retrieves the purchase rate for all your searches with at least one purchase event, including a daily breakdown.

    By default, the analyzed period includes the last eight days including the current day.

    The rate is the number of purchase conversion events divided by the number of tracked searches.
    A search is tracked if it returns a query ID (`clickAnalytics` is `true`).
    This differs from the response's `count`, which shows the overall number of searches, including those where `clickAnalytics` is `false`.

    **There's a difference between a 0 and null purchase rate when `clickAnalytics` is enabled:**

    - **Null** means there were no queries: since Algolia didn't receive any events, the purchase rate is null.
    - **0** mean there _were_ queries but no [purchase conversion events](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/getting-started) were received.
