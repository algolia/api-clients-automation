  summary: Retrieve add-to-cart rate
  description: |
    Retrieves the add-to-cart rate for all your searches with at least one add-to-cart event, including a daily breakdown.

    By default, the analyzed period includes the last eight days including the current day.

    The rate is the number of add-to-cart conversion events divided by the number of tracked searches.
    A search is tracked if it returns a queryID (`clickAnalytics` is `true`).
    This differs from the response's `count`, which shows the overall number of searches, including those where `clickAnalytics` is `false`.

    **There's a difference between a 0 and null add-to-cart rate when `clickAnalytics` is enabled:**

    - **Null** means there were no queries: since Algolia didn't receive any events, the add-to-cart rate is null.
    - **0** mean there _were_ queries but no [add-to-cart events](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/getting-started) were received.
