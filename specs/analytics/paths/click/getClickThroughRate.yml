  summary: Retrieve click-through rate
  description: |
    Retrieves the click-through rate (CTR) for all your searches with at least one click event, including a daily breakdown.

    By default, the analyzed period includes the last eight days including the current day.

    **There's a difference between a 0 and null CTR when `clickAnalytics` is enabled:**

    - **Null** means there were no queries: since Algolia didn't receive any events, CTR is null.
    - **0** mean there _were_ queries but no [click events](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/getting-started) were received.
