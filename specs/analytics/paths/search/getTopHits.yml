  summary: Retrieve top search results
  description: |
    Retrieves the object IDs of the 1,000 most frequent search results.

    If you set the `clickAnalytics` query parameter to `true`, the response also includes:

    - Tracked searches count.
      Tracked searches are Search API requests with `clickAnalytics` set to `true`.
      This differs from the response's `count`, which includes searches where `clickAnalytics` is `false`.
    - Click count
    - Click-through rate (CTR)
    - Conversion count
    - Conversion rate (CR)
    - Average click position

    If you set the `revenueAnalytics` parameter to `true`, the response also includes:

    - Add-to-cart count
    - Add-to-cart rate (ATCR)
    - Purchase count
    - Purchase rate
    - Revenue details for each currency

    **There's a difference between 0% rates and null rates:**

    - **Null** means there were no queries. Algolia didn't receive any events, so rates are null.
    - **0% rates** mean there were queries but no [click or conversion events](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/getting-started) were received.
