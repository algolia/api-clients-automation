  summary: Retrieve top searches
  description: |
    Returns the most popular searches. For each search, it also includes the average number of hits.

    If you set the `clickAnalytics` query parameter to `true`, the response also includes

    - Tracked searches count. Tracked searches are Search API requests with the `clickAnalytics` parameter set to `true`. This differs from the response's `count`, which shows the overall number of searches, including those where `clickAnalytics` is `false`.
    - Click count
    - Click-through rate (CTR)
    - Conversion count
    - Conversion rate (CR)
    - Average click position

    If you set the `revenueAnalytics` query parameter to `true`, the response also includes:

    - Add-to-cart count
    - Add-to-cart rate (ATCR)
    - Purchase count
    - Purchase rate
    - Revenue details for each currency

    **There's a difference between 0% rates and null rates:**

    - **Null** means there were no queries: since Algolia didn't receive any events, the rates (CTR, CR, ATCR, purchase rate) are null.
    - **0% rates** mean there _were_ queries but no [click or conversion events](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/getting-started/) were received.
