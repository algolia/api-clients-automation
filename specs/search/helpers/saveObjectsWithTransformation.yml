    summary: Save objects to an Algolia index by leveraging the Transformation pipeline setup using the Push connector (https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/connectors/push/)
    description: |
      Helper: Similar to the `saveObjects` method but requires a Push connector (https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/connectors/push/) to be created first, in order to transform records before indexing them to Algolia. The `region` must have been passed to the client instantiation method.
