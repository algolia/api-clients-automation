    summary: Create secured API keys
    description: |
      Generates a secured API key without any requests to Algolia's servers.

      Secured API keys are API keys that you generate on your server without any API request to Algolia.
      Secured API keys help in environments where you can't easily update the client-side code, such as mobile apps,
      or when you need to restrict access to a part of your index for every user.

      When your users start searching, instead of using the Search API key, they request a short-lived secured API key from your server.
      On your server, you use this method to create a secured API key, with any restrictions you'd like, such as filters, index access restrictions,
      or expiration times. The API key gets longer the more restrictions you add.
      Your users then use the secured API key to search with Algolia.

      You can't create secured API keys from other secured API keys or from your Admin API key.
      The generated API key can have the same restrictions as the parent API key, or be more restrictive.

    filters:
      type: string
      description: |
        Filters that apply to every search made with the secured API key.
        Extra filters added at search time will be combined with `AND`.
        For example, if you set `group:admin` as fixed filter on your generated API key,
        and add `groups:visitors` to the search query, the complete set of filters will be `group:admin AND groups:visitors`.

    restrictIndices:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      description: |
        Index names or patterns that this API key can access.
        By default, an API key can access all indices in the same application.

        You can use leading and trailing wildcard characters (`*`):

        - `dev_*` matches all indices starting with "dev_".
        - `*_dev` matches all indices ending with "_dev".
        - `*_products_*` matches all indices containing "_products_".
    restrictSources:
      type: string
      description: |
        IP network that are allowed to use this key.

        You can only add a single source, but you can provide a range of IP addresses.
        Use this to protect against API key leaking and reuse.
      example: '192.168.1.0/24'
    userToken:
      type: string
      description: |
        Pseudonymous user identifier to restrict usage of this API key to specific users.

        By default, rate limits are set based on IP addresses. This can be an issue if many users search from the same IP address.
        To avoid this, add a user token to each generated API key.
