      Wait for a task to complete to ensure synchronized index updates.

      All Algolia write operations are asynchronous. When you make a request for a write operation, for example, to add or update records in your index, Algolia creates a task on a queue and returns a taskID. The task itself runs separately, depending on the server load.
