    summary: Get all records from an index
    description: |
      You can use the browse method to get records from an indexâ€”for example, to export your index as a backup. To export all records, use an empty query.

      Use browse instead of search when exporting records from your index, when ranking, or analytics, isn't important. The Analytics API doesn't collect data when using browse.

      Don't use this method for building a search UI. Use search instead.
