    summary: Replace all records in an index
    description: |
      This method replaces all records in an index without interrupting ongoing searches.
      
      It combines [batch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/batch) and [copy/move](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/operation-index) index operations:
      1. Copy settings, synonyms, and rules to a temporary index.
      2. Add the records from the `objects` parameter to the temporary index.
      3. Replace the original index with the temporary one.
      
      If there's an error during one of these steps, the temporary index is deleted if your API key has the `deleteIndex` ACL.
      
      If your API key restricts access to specific indices, make sure it also grants access to the temporary index INDEX_NAME_tmp_* (replace INDEX_NAME with the name of your original index).
      
      This method is subject to [indexing rate limits](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406975251089-Is-there-a-rate-limit-for-indexing-on-Algolia).
      
      The response includes the results of the individual API requests.
      
      This method creates a temporary index: your record count is temporarily doubled. Algolia doesn't count the three days with the highest number of records towards your monthly usage.
