    summary: Replace all records in an index
    description: |
      Replace all records from your index with a new set of records.

      This method lets you replace all records in your index without downtime. It performs these operations:
        1. Copy settings, synonyms, and rules from your original index to a temporary index.
        2. Add your new records to the temporary index.
        3. Replace your original index with the temporary index.

      Use the safe parameter to ensure that these (asynchronous) operations are performed in sequence.
      If there's an error duing one of these steps, the temporary index won't be deleted.
      This operation is rate-limited.
      This method creates a temporary index: your record count is temporarily doubled. Algolia doesn't count the three days with the highest number of records towards your monthly usage.
      If you're on a legacy plan (before July 2020), this method counts two operations towards your usage (in addition to the number of records): copySettings and moveIndex.
      The API key you use for this operation must have access to the index YourIndex and the temporary index YourIndex_tmp.
