  summary: Copy or move an index
  description: |
    Copies or moves (renames) an index within the same Algolia application.

    Notes:
    - Existing destination indices are overwritten, except for their analytics data.
    - If the destination index doesn't exist yet, it's created.
    - This operation is resource-intensive.

    **Copy**

    - If the source index doesn't exist, copying creates a new index with 0 records and default settings.
    - API keys from the source index are merged with the existing keys in the destination index.
    - You can't copy the `enableReRanking`, `mode`, and `replicas` settings.
    - You can't copy to a destination index that already has replicas.
    - Be aware of the [size limits](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/scaling/algolia-service-limits/#application-record-and-index-limits).
    - For more information, see [Copy indices](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/how-to/copy-indices).

    **Move**

    - If the source index doesn't exist, moving is ignored without returning an error.
    - When moving an index, the analytics data keeps its original name, and a new set of analytics data is started for the new name.
      To access the original analytics in the dashboard, create an index with the original name.
    - If the destination index has replicas, moving will overwrite the existing index and copy the data to the replica indices.
    - For more information, see [Move indices](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/how-to/move-indices).

    This operation is subject to [indexing rate limits](https://support.algolia.com/hc/articles/4406975251089-Is-there-a-rate-limit-for-indexing-on-Algolia).

                **Only for copying.**

                If you specify a scope, only the selected scopes are copied. Records and the other scopes are left unchanged.
                If you omit the `scope` parameter, everything is copied: records, settings, synonyms, and rules.
