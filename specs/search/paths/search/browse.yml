  summary: Get all index content.
  description: >
    This method allows you to retrieve all index content. It can retrieve up to 1,000 records per call and supports full text search and filters (with `params`).

    For performance reasons, it doesn't support:
    
    - The `distinct` query parameter
    - Sorting by typos, proximity, words, or geographical distance.
  parameters:
    - $ref: '../../../common/parameters.yml#/IndexName'
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: '../../common/schemas/BrowseParams.yml#/browseParams'
  responses:
    '200':
      description: OK
