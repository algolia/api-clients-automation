  summary: Browse for records
  description: |
    Retrieves records from an index, up to 1,000 per request.

    While searching retrieves _hits_ (records augmented with attributes for highlighting and ranking details),
    browsing _just_ returns matching records.
    This can be useful if you want to export your indices.

    - The Analytics API doesn't collect data when using `browse`.
    - Records are ranked by attributes and custom ranking.
    - Deduplication (`distinct`) is turned off.
    - There's no ranking for: typo-tolerance, number of matched words, proximity, geo distance.
