    Get records from an index, up to 1,000 per request.

    This can be useful if you want to export your indices.

    - The Analytics API doesn't collect data when using `browse`.
    - Don't use this method to build search UIs.
    - Records are ranked by attributes and custom ranking.
    - Deduplication and grouping (`distinct`) is turned off.
    - There's no ranking for: typo-tolerance, number of matched words, proximity, geo distance

    - To reduce the response size, select the attributes you want to include with the `attributesToRetrieve` parameter.
