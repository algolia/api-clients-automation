  summary: Search multiple indices
  description: |
    Sends multiple search request to one or more indices.

    This can be useful in these cases:

    - Different indices for different purposes, such as, one index for products, another one for marketing content.
    - Multiple searches to the same indexâ€”for example, with different filters.
