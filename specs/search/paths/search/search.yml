  summary: Search multiple indices
  description: |
    Sends multiple search requests to one or more indices.

    This can be useful in these cases:

      - Different indices for different purposes, such as, one index for products, another one for marketing content.
      - Multiple searches to the same index—for example, with different filters.

    Use the helper `searchForHits` or `searchForFacets` to get the results in a more convenient format, if you already know the return type you want.
