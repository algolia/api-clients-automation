  summary: Delete records matching a filter
  description: |
    This operation doesn't accept empty filters.

    This operation is resource-intensive.
    You should only use it if you can't get the object IDs of the records you want to delete.
    It's more efficient to get a list of object IDs with the [`browse` operation](#tag/Search/operation/browse),
    and then delete the records using the [`batch` operation](#tag/Records/operation/batch).

    This operation is subject to [indexing rate limits](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406975251089-Is-there-a-rate-limit-for-indexing-on-Algolia).
