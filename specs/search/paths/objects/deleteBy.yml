  summary: Delete records matching a query

    This operation doesn't accept empty queries or filters.

    It's more efficient to get a list of object IDs with the [`browse` operation](#tag/Search/operation/browse),
    and then delete the records using the [`batch` operation](#tag/Records/operation/batch).
