  summary: Retrieve a record
  description: |
    Retrieves one record by its object ID.

    To retrieve more than one record, use the [`objects` operation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/get-objects).
  parameters:
    - $ref: '../../../common/parameters.yml#/IndexName'
    - $ref: '../../../common/parameters.yml#/ObjectID'
    - name: attributesToRetrieve
      in: query
      description: |
        Attributes to include with the records in the response.
        This is useful to reduce the size of the API response.
        By default, all retrievable attributes are returned.

        `objectID` is always retrieved.

        Attributes included in `unretrievableAttributes`
        won't be retrieved unless the request is authenticated with the admin API key.

  summary: Add or replace a record
  description: |
    If a record with the specified object ID exists, the existing record is replaced.
    Otherwise, a new record is added to the index.

    If you want to use auto-generated object IDs, use the [`saveObject` operation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/save-object).
    To update _some_ attributes of an existing record, use the [`partial` operation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/partial-update-object) instead.
    To add, update, or replace multiple records, use the [`batch` operation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/batch).
