        This is useful to reduce the size of the API response.
        By default, all retrievable attributes are returned.

        `objectID` is always retrieved, even when not specified.

        Any attributes listed in [`unretrievableAttributes`](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-parameters/unretrievableAttributes/) won't be retrieved by `getObject` unless the request is authenticated with the admin API key.
