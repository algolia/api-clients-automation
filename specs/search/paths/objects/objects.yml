    Adds a record to an index or replaces it.

    - If the record doesn't have an object ID, a new record with an auto-generated object ID is added to your index.
    - If a record with the specified object ID exists, the existing record is replaced.
    - If a record with the specified object ID doesn't exist, a new record is added to your index.
    - If you add a record to an index that doesn't exist yet, a new index is created.

    To update _some_ attributes of a record, use the [`partial` operation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/partial-update-object).
    To add, update, or replace multiple records, use the [`batch` operation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/batch).

    This operation is subject to [indexing rate limits](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406975251089-Is-there-a-rate-limit-for-indexing-on-Algolia).

  summary: Delete an index
  description: |
    Deletes an index and all its settings.

    - Deleting an index doesn't delete its analytics data.
    - If you try to delete a non-existing index, the operation is ignored without warning.
    - If the index you want to delete has replica indices, the replicas become independent indices.
    - If the index you want to delete is a replica index, you must first unlink it from its primary index before you can delete it.
      For more information, see [Delete replica indices](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/how-to/deleting-replicas).
