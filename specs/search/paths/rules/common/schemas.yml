        Query pattern that triggers the rule.

        You can use either a literal string, or a special pattern `{facet:ATTRIBUTE}`, where `ATTRIBUTE` is a facet name.
        The rule is triggered if the query matches the literal string or a value of the specified facet.
        For example, with `pattern: {facet:genre}`, the rule is triggered when users search for a genre, such as "comedy".
      example: '{facet:genre}'

    filters:

      description: |
        Filters that trigger the rule.

        You can add filters using the syntax `facet:value` so that the rule is triggered, when the specific filter is selected.
        You can use `filters` on its own or combine it with the `pattern` parameter.
        You can't combine multiple filters with `OR` and you can't use numeric filters.
      example: 'genre:comedy'

anchoring:
  type: string
  description: |
    Which part of the search query the pattern should match:

    - `startsWith`. The pattern must match the beginning of the query.
    - `endsWith`. The pattern must match the end of the query.
    - `is`. The pattern must match the query exactly.
    - `contains`. The pattern must match anywhere in the query.

    Empty queries are only allowed as patterns with `anchoring: is`.

        Determines whether promoted records must also match active filters for the consequence to apply.

        This ensures user-applied filters take priority and irrelevant matches aren't shown.
        For example, if you promote a record with `color: red` but the user filters for `color: blue`,
        the "red" record won't be shown.

        > In the Algolia dashboard, when you use the **Pin an item** consequence, `filterPromotes` appears as the checkbox: **Pinned items must match active filters to be displayed.** For examples, see [Promote results with rules](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/how-to/promote-hits/#promote-results-matching-active-filters).
