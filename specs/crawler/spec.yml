  summary: The Crawler API lets you manage and run your crawlers
  description: |
    ## Base URL

    The base URL for making requests to the Crawler API is:

    - `https://crawler.algolia.com/api`

    **All requests must use HTTPS.**

    ## Availability and authentication
    
    To authenticate your API requests, use the **basic authentication** header:

    - `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`

    Where `<credentials>` is a base64-encoded string `<user-id>:<api-key>`.

    - `<user-id>`. The Crawler user ID.
    - `<api-key>`. The Crawler API key.

    You can find both on the [Crawler settings](https://dashboard.algolia.com/crawler/settings) page in the Algolia dashboard.
    The Crawler credentials are different from your regular Algolia credentials.

    ## Request format

    Request bodies must be JSON objects.

    ## Parameters

    Parameters are passed as query parameters for GET requests,
    and in the request body for POST and PATCH requests.

    Query parameters must be [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding).
    Non-ASCII characters must be UTF-8 encoded.

    ## Response status and errors

    The Crawler API returns JSON responses.
    Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response.

    Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status.
    Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.
    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.

    ## Version

    The current version of the Crawler API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.

      Change the state of crawlers, such as pausing crawl schedules or testing the crawler with specific URLs.
  - name: config
    x-displayName: Configuration
    description: |
      In the Crawler configuration, you specify which URLs to crawl, when to crawl, how to extract records from the crawl, and where to index the extracted records.

      The configuration is versioned, so you can always restore a previous version.

      It's easiest to make configuration changes on the [Crawler page](https://dashboard.algolia.com/crawler) in the Algolia dashboard.
      The editor has autocomplete and built-in validation so you can try your configuration changes before committing them.
