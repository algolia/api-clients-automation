    Change the crawler's name.

    While you _could_ use this endpoint to replace the crawler configuration,
    you should [update it](#tag/config/operation/patchConfig) instead since cnfiguration changes made here aren't [versioned](#tag/config/operation/listConfigVersions).

    If you replace the configuration, you must provide the full configuration,
    including any settings you want to keep.
