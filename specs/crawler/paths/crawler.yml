  summary: Update crawler
  description: |
    Updates the crawler, either its name or its configuration.

    Use this endpoint to update the crawler's name.
    While you can use this endpoint to completely replace the crawler's configuration,
    you should [update the crawler configuration](#tag/config/operation/patchConfig) instead.

    If you replace the configuration, you must provide the full configuration,
    including the settings you want to keep.
    Configuration changes from this endpoint aren't [versioned](#tag/config/operation/listConfigVersions).
