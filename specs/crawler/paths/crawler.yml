  summary: Replace crawler configuration
  description: |
    Replaces the crawler configuration with a new one.

    If you only want to change the crawler's name, you can use this operation.
    For other configuration changes, use the "Update configuration" endpoint instead instead,
    because changes made here aren't versioned.

    When replacing the configuration, you must provide the full configuration,
    including any settings you want to keep.
