                If true, the given URLs will be added to the `extraUrls` field of the config (if not already in `startUrls` or `sitemaps`).
                If false, the URLs will not be saved in the config.
                If unspecified, the URLs will be saved to the `extraUrls` field of the config only if they haven't been indexed during the last reindex.
