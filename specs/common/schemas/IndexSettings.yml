        Attributes used for [faceting](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/).

        Facets are attributes that let you categorize search results.
        They can be used for filtering search results.
        By default, no attribute is used for faceting.
        Attribute names are case-sensitive.

        **Modifiers**

        - `filterOnly("ATTRIBUTE")`.
          Allows the attribute to be used as a filter but doesn't evaluate the facet values.

        - `searchable("ATTRIBUTE")`.
          Allows searching for facet values.

        - `afterDistinct("ATTRIBUTE")`.
          Evaluates the facet count _after_ deduplication with `distinct`.
          This ensures accurate facet counts.
          You can apply this modifier to searchable facets: `afterDistinct(searchable(ATTRIBUTE))`.

      description: |
        Creates [replica indices](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/in-depth/replicas/).

        Replicas are copies of a primary index with the same records but different settings, synonyms, or rules.
        If you want to offer a different ranking or sorting of your search results, you'll use replica indices.
        All index operations on a primary index are automatically forwarded to its replicas.
        To add a replica index, you must provide the complete set of replicas to this parameter.
        If you omit a replica from this list, the replica turns into a regular, standalone index that will no longer be synced with the primary index.

        **Modifier**

        - `virtual("REPLICA")`.
          Create a virtual replica,
          Virtual replicas don't increase the number of records and are optimized for [Relevant sorting](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/in-depth/relevant-sort/).

        Attribute names are case-sensitive.

        Compound words are formed by combining two or more individual words,
        and are particularly prevalent in Germanic languages—for example, "firefighter".
        With decompounding, the individual components are indexed separately.

        You can specify different lists for different languages.
        Decompounding is supported for these languages:
        Dutch (`nl`), German (`de`), Finnish (`fi`), Danish (`da`), Swedish (`sv`), and Norwegian (`no`).
        Decompounding doesn't work for words with [non-spacing mark Unicode characters](https://www.charactercodes.net/category/non-spacing_mark).
        For example, `Gartenstühle` won't be decompounded if the `ü` consists of `u` (U+0075) and `◌̈` (U+0308).

        **You should always specify an indexing language.**
        If you don't specify an indexing language, the search engine uses all [supported languages](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/supported-languages/),
        or the languages you specified with the `ignorePlurals` or `removeStopWords` parameters.

        Attribute names are case-sensitive.

        By default, all numeric attributes are available as numerical filters.
        For faster indexing, reduce the number of numeric attributes.

        To turn off filtering for all numeric attributes, specify an attribute that doesn't exist in your index, such as `NO_NUMERIC_FILTERING`.

        **Modifier**

        - `equalOnly("ATTRIBUTE")`.
          Support only filtering based on equality comparisons `=` and `!=`.

        To include such characters, define them with `separatorsToIndex`.

        Separators are all non-letter characters except spaces and currency characters, such as $€£¥.

        With `separatorsToIndex`, Algolia treats separator characters as separate words.
        For example, in a search for "Disney+", Algolia considers "Disney" and "+" as two separate words.

        Attributes used for searching. Attribute names are case-sensitive.

        By default, all attributes are searchable and the [Attribute](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/#attribute) ranking criterion is turned off.
        With a non-empty list, Algolia only returns results with matches in the selected attributes.
        In addition, the Attribute ranking criterion is turned on: matches in attributes that are higher in the list of `searchableAttributes` rank first.
        To make matches in two attributes rank equally, include them in a comma-separated string, such as `"title,alternate_title"`.
        Attributes with the same priority are always unordered.

        For more information, see [Searchable attributes](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/setting-searchable-attributes/).

        **Modifier**

        - `unordered("ATTRIBUTE")`.
          Ignore the position of a match within the attribute.

        Without a modifier, matches at the beginning of an attribute rank higher than matches at the end.

        Attribute that should be used to establish groups of results.
        Attribute names are case-sensitive.

        All records with the same value for this attribute are considered a group.
        You can combine `attributeForDistinct` with the `distinct` search parameter to control
        how many items per group are included in the search results.

        If you want to use the same attribute also for faceting, use the `afterDistinct` modifier of the `attributesForFaceting` setting.
        This applies faceting _after_ deduplication, which will result in accurate facet counts.

        Records with missing values for your selected custom ranking attributes are always sorted last.
        Boolean attributes are sorted based on their alphabetical order.

        **Modifiers**

        - `asc("ATTRIBUTE")`.
          Sort the index by the values of an attribute, in ascending order.

        - `desc("ATTRIBUTE")`.
          Sort the index by the values of an attribute, in descending order.

        If you use two or more custom ranking attributes,
        [reduce the precision](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/how-to/controlling-custom-ranking-metrics-precision/) of your first attributes,

        The tie-breaking algorithm sequentially applies each criterion in the order they're specified.
        If you configure a replica index for [sorting by an attribute](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/how-to/sort-by-attribute/),
        you put the sorting attribute at the top of the list.

      Plurals and similar declensions added by the `ignorePlurals` setting are considered exact matches

    Turning off the Exact ranking criterion for these attributes favors exact matching on other attributes.
    This reduces the impact of individual attributes with a lot of content on ranking.

optionalWords:
  description: |
    Words that should be considered optional when found in the query.

    By default, records must match all words in the search query to be included in the search results.
    Adding optional words can help to increase the number of search results by running an additional search query that doesn't include the optional words.
    For example, if the search query is "action video" and "video" is an optional word,
    the search engine runs two queries. One for "action video" and one for "action".
    Records that match all words are ranked higher.

    For a search query with 4 or more words **and** all its words are optional,
    the number of matched words required for a record to be included in the search results increases for every 1,000 records:

    - If `optionalWords` has less than 10 words, the required number of matched words increases by 1:
      results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 2 matched words.
    - If `optionalWords` has 10 or more words, the number of required matched words increases by the number of optional words divided by 5 (rounded down).
      For example, with 18 optional words: results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 4 matched words.
