    - `min`. Return matches with the lowest number of typos.
      For example, if you have matches without typos, only include those.
      But if there are no matches without typos (with 1 typo), include matches with 1 typo (2 typos).
    - `strict`. Return matches with the two lowest numbers of typos.
      With `strict`, the Typo ranking criterion is applied first in the `ranking` setting.
