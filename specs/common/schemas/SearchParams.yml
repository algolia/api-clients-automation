aroundRadius:

    Maximum radius for a search around a central location.

    This parameter works in combination with the `aroundLatLng` and `aroundLatLngViaIP` parameters.
    By default, the search radius is determined automatically from the density of hits around the central location.
    The search radius is small if there are many hits close to the central coordinates.

    Filter the search by facet values, so that only records with the same facet values are retrieved.

    **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**

    - `[filter1, filter2]` is interpreted as `filter1 AND filter2`.
    - `[[filter1, filter2], filter3]` is interpreted as `filter1 OR filter2 AND filter3`.
    - `facet:-value` is interpreted as `NOT facet:value`.

    While it's best to avoid attributes that start with a `-`, you can still filter them by escaping with a backslash:
    `facet:\-value`.
  example: [['category:Book', 'category:-Movie'], 'author:John Doe']

  type: boolean
  description: |
    Whether faceting should be applied after deduplication with `distinct`
    This leads to accurate facet counts when using faceting in combination with `distinct`.
    It's usually better to use `afterDistinct` modifiers in the `attributesForFaceting` setting,
    as `facetingAfterDistinct` only computes correct facet counts if all records have the same facet values for the `attributeForDistinct`.
  default: false
  x-categories:
    - Faceting

filters:
  type: string
  description: |
    Filter expression to only include items that match the filter criteria in the response.

    You can use these filter expressions:

    - **Numeric filters.** `<facet> <op> <number>`, where `<op>` is one of `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`.
    - **Ranges.** `<facet>:<lower> TO <upper>` where `<lower>` and `<upper>` are the lower and upper limits of the range (inclusive).
    - **Facet filters.** `<facet>:<value>` where `<facet>` is a facet attribute (case-sensitive) and `<value>` a facet value.
    - **Tag filters.** `_tags:<value>` or just `<value>` (case-sensitive).
    - **Boolean filters.** `<facet>: true | false`.

    You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators with the following restrictions:

    - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`.
      **Not supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`.
    - You can't use `NOT` with combinations of filters.
      **Not supported:** `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)`
    - You can't combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`.
      **Not supported:** `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)`

    Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes.
    If a facet attribute is an array, the filter matches if it matches at least one element of the array.

    **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**

    You can use numeric comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`.
    Comparisons are precise up to 3 decimals.
    You can also provide ranges: `facet:<lower> TO <upper>`. The range includes the lower and upper boundaries.
    The same combination rules apply as for `facetFilters`.

optionalFilters:
  description: |
    Filters to promote or demote records in the search results.

    Optional filters work like facet filters, but they don't exclude records from the search results.
    Records that match the optional filter rank before records that don't match.
    If you're using a negative filter `facet:-value`, matching records rank after records that don't match.

    - Optional filters don't work on virtual replicas.
    - Optional filters are applied _after_ sort-by attributes.
    - Optional filters are applied _before_ custom ranking attributes (in the default [ranking](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria)).
    - Optional filters don't work with numeric attributes.

    - `removeStopWords` is set to true.
    - `words` is set as the first ranking criterion.
    - All remaining words are treated as `optionalWords`
    Since the `similarQuery` is supposed to do a broad search, they usually return many results.

    Different from regular facets, `_tags` can only be used for filtering (including or excluding records).
    You won't get a facet count.
