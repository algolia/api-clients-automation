   * Unique user IP address. This can be useful when you want to impose a rate limit on specific users. By default, rate limits are set based on the IP address. This can become an issue when several users search from the same IP address. To avoid this, you can set a unique userToken for each user when generating their API key. This lets you restrict each user to a maximum number of API calls per hour, even if they share their IP with another user. Specifying the userToken in a secured API key is also a good security practice as it ensures users don\'t change it. Many features like Analytics, Personalization, and Dynamic Re-ranking rely on the authenticity of user identifiers. Setting the userToken at the API key level ensures that downstream services work as expected and prevents abuse.
