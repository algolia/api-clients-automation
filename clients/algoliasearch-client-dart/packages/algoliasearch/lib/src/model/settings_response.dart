Allows the attribute to be used as a filter but doesn't evaluate the facet values.  - `searchable(\"ATTRIBUTE\")`.   Allows searching for facet values.  - `afterDistinct(\"ATTRIBUTE\")`.   Evaluates the facet count _after_ deduplication with `distinct`.   This ensures accurate facet counts.   You can apply this modifier to searchable facets: `afterDistinct(searchable(ATTRIBUTE))`.
