/**
 * Click event after an Algolia request.  Use this event to track when users click items in the search results. If you're building your category pages with Algolia, you'll also use this event.
 *
 * @param eventName The name of the event, up to 64 ASCII characters.  Consider naming events consistently—for example, by adopting Segment's [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework) framework.
 * @param eventType
 * @param index The name of an Algolia index.
 * @param objectIDs The object IDs of the records that are part of the event.
 * @param positions The position of the clicked item the search results.  The first search result has a position of 1 (not 0). You must provide 1 `position` for each `objectID`.
 * @param queryID Unique identifier for a search query.  The query ID is required for events related to search or browse requests. If you add `clickAnalytics: true` as a search request parameter, the query ID is included in the API response.
 * @param userToken An anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier.  > **Note**: Never include personally identifiable information in user tokens.
 * @param authenticatedUserToken An identifier for authenticated users.  > **Note**: Never include personally identifiable information in user tokens.
 * @param timestamp The timestamp of the event in milliseconds in [Unix epoch time](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). By default, the Insights API uses the time it receives an event as its timestamp.
