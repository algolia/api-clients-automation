 * @description Deduplication positioning configures how a duplicate result should be resolved between an injected item and main search results. Current configuration supports: - 'highest': always select the item in the highest position, and remove duplicates that appear lower in the results. - 'highestInjected': duplicate result will be moved to its highest possible injected position, but not higher.    If a duplicate appears higher in main search results, it will be removed to stay it's intended group position (which could be lower than main).
