/** A/B Testing API The Algolia A/B Testing API lets you manage your Algolia A/B tests to optimize your search
  * experience. ## Base URLs The base URLs for requests to the A/B testing API are: - `https://analytics.us.algolia.com`
  * \- `https://analytics.de.algolia.com` - `https://analytics.algolia.com` (routes requests to the closest of the above
  * servers, based on your geographical location) Use the URL that matches your [analytics
  * region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Availability and authentication Access to the A/B testing API is available as part of the [Premium or Elevate
  * plans](https://www.algolia.com/pricing). To authenticate your API requests, add these headers: -
  * `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary
