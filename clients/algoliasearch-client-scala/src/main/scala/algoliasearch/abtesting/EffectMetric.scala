/** A/B Testing API The Algolia A/B Testing API lets you manage your Algolia A/B tests to optimize your search
  * experience. ## Base URLs The base URLs for requests to the A/B testing API are: - `https://analytics.us.algolia.com`
  * \- `https://analytics.de.algolia.com` - `https://analytics.algolia.com` (alias of `analytics.us.algolia.com`) Use
  * the URL that matches your [analytics region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All
  * requests must use HTTPS.** ## Availability and authentication Access to the A/B testing API is available as part of
  * the [Premium or Elevate plans](https://www.algolia.com/pricing). To authenticate your API requests, add these
  * headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the
  * necessary permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in
  * each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Rate limits You can make up to **100 requests per
  * minute per app** to the A/B testing API. The response includes headers with information about the limits. ##

  * UTF-8 encoded. Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces. ## Response status and errors The A/B testing API
  * returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in
  * the API response. Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are
  * indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Version The current
