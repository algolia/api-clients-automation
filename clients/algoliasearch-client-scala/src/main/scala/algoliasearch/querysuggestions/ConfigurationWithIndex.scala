/** Query Suggestions API Query Suggestions add new indices to your Algolia application with popular search queries,
  * external suggestions, or facet values. In your user interface, you can query the Query Suggestions indices like
  * regular indices and add [suggested
  * searches](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/query-suggestions/js) to guide
  * users and speed up their search. ## Base URLs The base URLs for requests to the Query Suggestions API are: -
  * `https://query-suggestions.us.algolia.com` - `https://query-suggestions.eu.algolia.com` Use the URL that matches
  * your [analytics region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All requests must use
  * HTTPS.** ## Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your
  * Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The
  * required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. You can find your
  * application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Request
  * format Request bodies must be JSON objects. ## Response status and errors Response bodies are JSON objects. Deleting
  * a user token returns an empty response body with rate-limiting information as headers. Successful responses return a
  * `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses
  * have a `message` property with more information. ## Version The current version of the Query Suggestions API is
  * version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
