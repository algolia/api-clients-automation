/** Query Suggestions API Query Suggestions add new indices to your Algolia application with popular search queries,
  * external suggestions, or facet values. In your user interface, you can query the Query Suggestions indices like
  * regular indices and add [suggested
  * searches](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/query-suggestions/js) to guide
  * users and speed up their search. ## Base URLs Base URLs for the Query Suggestions API: -
  * `https://query-suggestions.us.algolia.com` - `https://query-suggestions.eu.algolia.com` Use the URL that matches
  * your [analytics region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All requests must use
  * HTTPS.** ## Authentication Add these headers to authenticate requests: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia
  * application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The required
  * access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID
  * and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Request format Request
  * bodies must be JSON objects. ## Response status and errors Response bodies are JSON objects. Deleting a user token
  * returns an empty response body with rate-limiting information as headers. Successful responses return `2xx`
  * statuses. Client errors return `4xx` statuses. Server errors return `5xx` statuses. Error responses have a `message`
  * property with more information. ## Version The current version of the Query Suggestions API is version 1, indicated
  * by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
