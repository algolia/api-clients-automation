/** Query Suggestions API The Query Suggestions API lets you manage your Query Suggestions configurations. Query
  * Suggestions add new indices to your Algolia application with popular search queries, external suggestions, or facet
  * values. In your user interface, you can query the Query Suggestions indices like regular indices and add [suggested
  * searches](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/query-suggestions/js/) to guide
  * users and speed up their search. # Base URLs The base URLs for making requests to the Query Suggestions API are: -
  * `https://query-suggestions.us.algolia.com` - `https://query-suggestions.eu.algolia.com` Use the URL that matches
  * your [analytics region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All requests must use
  * HTTPS.** # Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add these headers: <dl>
  * <dt><code>x-algolia-application-id</code></dt> <dd>Your Algolia application ID.</dd>
  * <dt><code>x-algolia-api-key</code></dt> <dd> An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The
  * required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. </dd> </dl> You can
  * find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). # Request
  * format Request bodies must be JSON objects. # Response status and errors Response bodies are JSON objects. Deleting
  * a user token returns an empty response body with rate-limiting information as headers. Successful responses return a
  * `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses
  * have a `message` property with more information. # Version The current version of the Query Suggestions API is
  * version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
