/** Query Suggestions API The Query Suggestions API lets you manage your Query Suggestions configurations. Query
  * Suggestions add new indices to your Algolia application with popular search queries, external suggestions, or facet
  * values. In your user interface, you can query the Query Suggestions indices like regular indices and add [suggested
  * searches](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/query-suggestions/js) to guide
  * users and speed up their search. ## Base URLs The base URLs for requests to the Query Suggestions API are: -
  * `https://query-suggestions.us.algolia.com` - `https://query-suggestions.eu.algolia.com` Use the URL that matches
  * your [analytics region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All requests must use
  * HTTPS.** ## Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your
  * Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The
  * required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. You can find your
  * application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). ## Request format
  * Request bodies must be JSON objects. ## Response status and errors Response bodies are JSON objects. Deleting a user
  * token returns an empty response body with rate-limiting information as headers. Successful responses return a `2xx`
  * status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a
  * `message` property with more information. ## Version The current version of the Query Suggestions API is version 1,
  * as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
