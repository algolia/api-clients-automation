/** Recommend API The Recommend API lets you retrieve recommendations from one of Algolia's AI recommendation models
  * that you previously trained on your data. ## Client libraries Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably
  * integrate Algolia's APIs with your apps. The official API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level
  * Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla). See: [Algolia's
  * ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem) ## Base URLs The
  * base URLs for requests to the Recommend API are: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`. If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search
  * Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra), this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both
  * URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Retry strategy To guarantee a high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of
  * your servers as fallbacks: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com` These URLs use a different
  * DNS provider than the primary URLs. You should randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers.
  * All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy. ## Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add
  * these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the
  * necessary permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in
  * each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). ## Request format Request bodies must be JSON objects. ##
  * Response status and errors The Recommend API returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific
  * ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response. Successful responses return a `2xx` status.
  * Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message`
  * property with more information. ## Version The current version of the Recommend API is version 1, as indicated by
  * the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0

/** Filter or boost recommendations matching a facet filter.
  *
  * @param automaticFacetFilters
  *   Filter recommendations that match or don't match the same `facet:facet_value` combination as the viewed item.
  * @param filters
  *   Filter expression to only include items that match the filter criteria in the response. You can use these filter
  *   expressions: - **Numeric filters.** `<facet> <op> <number>`, where `<op>` is one of `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`,
  *   `>=`. - **Ranges.** `<facet>:<lower> TO <upper>` where `<lower>` and `<upper>` are the lower and upper limits of
  *   the range (inclusive). - **Facet filters.** `<facet>:<value>` where `<facet>` is a facet attribute
  *   (case-sensitive) and `<value>` a facet value. - **Tag filters.** `_tags:<value>` or just `<value>`
  *   (case-sensitive). - **Boolean filters.** `<facet>: true | false`. You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and
  *   `NOT` operators with the following restrictions: - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`. **Not
  *   supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`. - You can't use `NOT` with combinations of filters. **Not supported:**
  *   `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)` - You can't combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`. **Not supported:**
  *   `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)` Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or
  *   facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes. If a facet attribute is an array, the filter
  *   matches if it matches at least one element of the array. For more information, see
  *   [Filters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering).
  * @param optionalFilters
  *   Filters to promote or demote records in the search results. Optional filters work like facet filters, but they
  *   don't exclude records from the search results. Records that match the optional filter rank before records that
  *   don't match. Matches with higher weights (`<score=N>`) rank before matches with lower weights. If you're using a
  *   negative filter `facet:-value`, matching records rank after records that don't match.
