/** Recommend API ## Client libraries Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with
  * your apps. The official API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level
  * Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla). For more information, see [Algolia's
  * ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem). ## Base URLs
  * Base URLs for the Recommend API: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`. If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search
  * Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra), this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both
  * URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Retry strategy To guarantee a high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of
  * your servers as fallbacks: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com` These URLs use a different
  * DNS provider than the primary URLs. Randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers. All Algolia
  * API clients implement this retry strategy. ## Authentication Add these headers to authenticate requests: -
  * `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary
  * permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each
  * endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Request format Request bodies must be JSON objects.
  * ## Response status and errors The Recommend API returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific
  * ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response. Successful responses return `2xx` statuses.
  * Client errors return `4xx` statuses. Server errors return `5xx` statuses. Error responses have a `message` property
  * with more information. ## Version The current version of the Recommend API is version 1, indicated by the `/1/` in
  * each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
  *
  * NOTE: This class is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech).

/** Words that should be considered optional when found in the query. By default, records must match all words in the
  * search query to be included in the search results. Adding optional words can increase the number of search results
  * by running an additional search query that doesn't include the optional words. For example, if the search query is
  * \"action video\" and \"video\" is optional, the search engine runs two queries: one for \"action video\" and one for
  * \"action\". Records that match all words are ranked higher. For a search query with 4 or more words **and** all its
  * words are optional, the number of matched words required for a record to be included in the search results increases
  * for every 1,000 records: - If `optionalWords` has fewer than 10 words, the required number of matched words
  * increases by 1: results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word; results 1,001 to 2,000 need 2 matched words. - If
  * `optionalWords` has 10 or more words, the required number of matched words increases by the number of optional words
  * divided by 5 (rounded down). Example: with 18 optional words, results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word; results
  * 1,001 to 2,000 need 4 matched words. For more information, see [Optional
  * words](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/empty-or-insufficient-results/#creating-a-list-of-optional-words).
