/** Recommend API The Recommend API lets you retrieve recommendations from one of Algolia's AI recommendation models
  * that you previously trained on your data. ## Client libraries Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably
  * integrate Algolia's APIs with your apps. The official API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level
  * Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/). See: [Algolia's
  * ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem/) ## Base URLs
  * The base URLs for requests to the Recommend API are: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`. If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search
  * Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra), this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both
  * URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Retry strategy To guarantee a high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of
  * your servers as fallbacks: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com` These URLs use a different
  * DNS provider than the primary URLs. You should randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers.
  * All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy. ## Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add
  * these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the
  * necessary permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in
  * each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). ## Request format Request bodies must be JSON objects. ##
  * Response status and errors The Recommend API returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific
  * ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response. Successful responses return a `2xx` status.
  * Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message`
  * property with more information. ## Version The current version of the Recommend API is version 1, as indicated by
  * the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0

/** BaseRecommendSearchParams
  *
  * @param similarQuery
  *   Keywords to be used instead of the search query to conduct a more broader search Using the `similarQuery`
  *   parameter changes other settings - `queryType` is set to `prefixNone`. - `removeStopWords` is set to true. -
  *   `words` is set as the first ranking criterion. - All remaining words are treated as `optionalWords` Since the
  *   `similarQuery` is supposed to do a broad search, they usually return many results. Combine it with `filters` to
  *   narrow down the list of results.
  * @param filters
  *   Filter expression to only include items that match the filter criteria in the response. You can use these filter
  *   expressions: - **Numeric filters.** `<facet> <op> <number>`, where `<op>` is one of `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`,
  *   `>=`. - **Ranges.** `<facet>:<lower> TO <upper>` where `<lower>` and `<upper>` are the lower and upper limits of
  *   the range (inclusive). - **Facet filters.** `<facet>:<value>` where `<facet>` is a facet attribute
  *   (case-sensitive) and `<value>` a facet value. - **Tag filters.** `_tags:<value>` or just `<value>`
  *   (case-sensitive). - **Boolean filters.** `<facet>: true | false`. You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and
  *   `NOT` operators with the following restrictions: - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`. **Not
  *   supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`. - You can't use `NOT` with combinations of filters. **Not supported:**
  *   `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)` - You can't combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`. **Not supported:**
  *   `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)` Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or
  *   facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes. If a facet attribute is an array, the filter
  *   matches if it matches at least one element of the array. For more information, see
  *   [Filters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/).
  * @param sumOrFiltersScores
  *   Whether to sum all filter scores If true, all filter scores are summed. Otherwise, the maximum filter score is
  *   kept. For more information, see [filter
  *   scores](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/in-depth/filter-scoring/#accumulating-scores-with-sumorfiltersscores).
  * @param restrictSearchableAttributes
  *   Restricts a search to a subset of your searchable attributes. Attribute names are case-sensitive.
  * @param facets
  *   Facets for which to retrieve facet values that match the search criteria and the number of matching facet values
  *   To retrieve all facets, use the wildcard character `*`. For more information, see
  *   [facets](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/#contextual-facet-values-and-counts).
  * @param facetingAfterDistinct
  *   Whether faceting should be applied after deduplication with `distinct` This leads to accurate facet counts when
  *   using faceting in combination with `distinct`. It's usually better to use `afterDistinct` modifiers in the
  *   `attributesForFaceting` setting, as `facetingAfterDistinct` only computes correct facet counts if all records have
  *   the same facet values for the `attributeForDistinct`.
  * @param aroundLatLng
  *   Coordinates for the center of a circle, expressed as a comma-separated string of latitude and longitude. Only
  *   records included within a circle around this central location are included in the results. The radius of the
  *   circle is determined by the `aroundRadius` and `minimumAroundRadius` settings. This parameter is ignored if you
  *   also specify `insidePolygon` or `insideBoundingBox`.
  * @param aroundLatLngViaIP
  *   Whether to obtain the coordinates from the request's IP address.
  * @param minimumAroundRadius
  *   Minimum radius (in meters) for a search around a location when `aroundRadius` isn't set.
  * @param insidePolygon
  *   Coordinates of a polygon in which to search. Polygons are defined by 3 to 10,000 points. Each point is represented
  *   by its latitude and longitude. Provide multiple polygons as nested arrays. For more information, see [filtering
  *   inside
  *   polygons](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/geolocation/#filtering-inside-rectangular-or-polygonal-areas).
  *   This parameter is ignored if you also specify `insideBoundingBox`.
  * @param naturalLanguages
  *   ISO language codes that adjust settings that are useful for processing natural language queries (as opposed to
  *   keyword searches) - Sets `removeStopWords` and `ignorePlurals` to the list of provided languages. - Sets
  *   `removeWordsIfNoResults` to `allOptional`. - Adds a `natural_language` attribute to `ruleContexts` and
  *   `analyticsTags`.
  * @param ruleContexts
  *   Assigns a rule context to the search query [Rule
  *   contexts](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/rules/rules-overview/how-to/customize-search-results-by-platform/#whats-a-context)
  *   are strings that you can use to trigger matching rules.
  * @param personalizationImpact
  *   Impact that Personalization should have on this search The higher this value is, the more Personalization
  *   determines the ranking compared to other factors. For more information, see [Understanding Personalization
  *   impact](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/personalization/personalizing-results/in-depth/configuring-personalization/#understanding-personalization-impact).
  * @param userToken
  *   Unique pseudonymous or anonymous user identifier. This helps with analytics and click and conversion events. For
  *   more information, see [user token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken/).
  * @param getRankingInfo
  *   Whether the search response should include detailed ranking information.
  * @param synonyms
  *   Whether to take into account an index's synonyms for this search.
  * @param clickAnalytics
  *   Whether to include a `queryID` attribute in the response The query ID is a unique identifier for a search query
  *   and is required for tracking [click and conversion
  *   events](https://www.algolia.com/guides/sending-events/getting-started/).
  * @param analytics
  *   Whether this search will be included in Analytics.
  * @param analyticsTags
  *   Tags to apply to the query for [segmenting analytics
  *   data](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/search-analytics/guides/segments/).
  * @param percentileComputation
  *   Whether to include this search when calculating processing-time percentiles.
  * @param enableABTest
  *   Whether to enable A/B testing for this search.
