/** Recommend API ## Client libraries Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with
  * your apps. The official API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level
  * Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla). For more information, see [Algolia's
  * ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem). ## Base URLs
  * Base URLs for the Recommend API: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`. If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search
  * Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra), this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both
  * URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Retry strategy To guarantee a high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of
  * your servers as fallbacks: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com` These URLs use a different
  * DNS provider than the primary URLs. Randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers. All Algolia
  * API clients implement this retry strategy. ## Authentication Add these headers to authenticate requests: -
  * `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary
  * permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each
  * endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Request format Request bodies must be JSON objects.
  * ## Response status and errors The Recommend API returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific
  * ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response. Successful responses return `2xx` statuses.
  * Client errors return `4xx` statuses. Server errors return `5xx` statuses. Error responses have a `message` property
  * with more information. ## Version The current version of the Recommend API is version 1, indicated by the `/1/` in
  * each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
  *
  * NOTE: This class is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech).

/** Filter the search by facet values, so that only records with the same facet values are retrieved. **Prefer using the
  * `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.** - `[filter1,
  * filter2]` is interpreted as `filter1 AND filter2`. - `[[filter1, filter2], filter3]` is interpreted as `filter1 OR
  * filter2 AND filter3`. - `facet:-value` is interpreted as `NOT facet:value`. While it's best to avoid attributes that
  * start with a `-`, you can still filter them by escaping with a backslash: `facet:\\-value`.
