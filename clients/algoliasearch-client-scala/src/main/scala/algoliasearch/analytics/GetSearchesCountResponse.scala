/** Analytics API The Analytics API gives you access to metrics related to your Algolia search experience. ## Base URLs
  * The base URLs for requests to the Analytics API are: - `https://analytics.us.algolia.com` -
  * `https://analytics.de.algolia.com` - `https://analytics.algolia.com` (alias of `analytics.us.algolia.com`) Use the
  * URL that matches your [analytics region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All
  * requests must use HTTPS.** ## Availability and authentication Access to the Analytics API is available as part of
  * the [Premium or Elevate plans](https://www.algolia.com/pricing). To authenticate your API requests, add these
  * headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the
  * necessary permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in
  * each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Rate limits You can make up to **100 requests per
  * minute per app** to the Analytics API. The response includes headers with information about the limits. ##
  * Parameters Query parameters must be
  * [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). Non-ASCII characters must be
  * UTF-8 encoded. Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces. ## Response status and errors The Analytics API
  * returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in
  * the API response. - Successful responses return a `2xx` status - Client errors return a `4xx` status - Server errors
  * are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Version The
  * current version of the Analytics API is version 2, as indicated by the `/2/` in each endpoint's URL. ## Query
  * aggregation Algolia accepts queries on each keystroke. To ensure you have relevant analytics data, however, the
  * series of keystrokes is aggregated to keep only the latest (final) user query. This is called \"prefix\"
  * aggregation. For more information, see [Query agggregation and
  * processing](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/search-analytics/concepts/query-aggregation). See the analytics
  * implementation overview for more information about query aggregation.
