/** Use this event to track when users make a purchase unrelated to a previous Algolia request. For example, if you
  * don't use Algolia to build your category pages, use this event. To track purchase events related to Algolia
  * requests, use the \"Purchased object IDs after search\" event.
  *
  * @param eventName
  *   The name of the event, up to 64 ASCII characters. Consider naming events consistentlyâ€”for example, by adopting
  *   Segment's
  *   [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework)
  *   framework.
  * @param index
  *   The name of an Algolia index.
  * @param objectIDs
  *   The object IDs of the records that are part of the event.
  * @param userToken
  *   An anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier. > **Note**: Never include personally identifiable information in
  *   user tokens.
  * @param authenticatedUserToken
  *   An identifier for authenticated users. > **Note**: Never include personally identifiable information in user
  *   tokens.
  * @param currency
  *   Three-letter [currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html).
  * @param objectData
  *   Extra information about the records involved in a purchase or add-to-cart event. If specified, it must have the
  *   same length as `objectIDs`.
  * @param timestamp
  *   The timestamp of the event in milliseconds in [Unix epoch time](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). By default,
  *   the Insights API uses the time it receives an event as its timestamp.
