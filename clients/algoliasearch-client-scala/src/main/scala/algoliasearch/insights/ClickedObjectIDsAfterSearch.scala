import algoliasearch.insights.ClickEvent._

/** Click event after an Algolia request. Use this event to track when users click items in the search results. If
  * you're building your category pages with Algolia, you'll also use this event.
  *
  * @param eventName
  *   Can contain up to 64 ASCII characters. Consider naming events consistentlyâ€”for example, by adopting Segment's
  *   [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework)
  *   framework.
  * @param index
  *   Name of the Algolia index.
  * @param objectIDs
  *   List of object identifiers for items of an Algolia index.
  * @param positions
  *   Position of the clicked objects in the search results. The first search result has a position of 1 (not 0). You
  *   must provide 1 `position` for each `objectID`.
  * @param queryID
  *   Unique identifier for a search query. The query ID is required for events related to search or browse requests. If
  *   you add `clickAnalytics: true` as a search request parameter, the query ID is included in the API response.
  * @param userToken
  *   Anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier. > **Note**: Never include personally identifiable information in user
  *   tokens.
  * @param timestamp
  *   Time of the event in milliseconds in [Unix epoch time](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). By default, the
  *   Insights API uses the time it receives an event as its timestamp.
  * @param authenticatedUserToken
  *   User token for authenticated users.
