/** Insights API The Insights API lets you collect events related to your search and discovery experience. Events
  * represent user interactions with your app or website. They unlock powerful features, such as recommendations,
  * personalization, smarter search results, and analytics that help you optimize your user experience. ## Client
  * libraries Use Algolia's API clients, libraries, and integrations to collect events from your UI and send them to the
  * Insights API. See: [Algolia's
  * ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem). ## Base URLs
  * The base URLs for making requests to the Insights API are: - `https://insights.us.algolia.io` -
  * `https://insights.de.algolia.io` - `https//insights.algolia.io` (routes requests to the closest of the above
  * servers, based on your geographical location) **All requests must use HTTPS.** ## Authentication To authenticate
  * your API requests, add these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. -
  * `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The required access control list
  * (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the
  * [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). ## Request format Request bodies must be JSON objects.
  * ## Response status and errors Response bodies are JSON objects. Deleting a user token returns an empty response body
  * with rate-limiting information as headers. Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx`
  * status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message` property with more
  * information. The Insights API doesn't validate if the event parameters such as `indexName`, `objectIDs`, or
  * `userToken`, correspond to anything in the Search API. It just checks if they're formatted correctly. Check the
  * [Events](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events/health) health section, whether your events can be used for Algolia
  * features such as Analytics, or Dynamic Re-Ranking. ## Version The current version of the Insights API is version 1,
  * as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
