import algoliasearch.insights.ClickEvent._

/** Use this event to track when users click items unrelated to a previous Algolia request. For example, if you don't
  * use Algolia to build your category pages, use this event. To track click events related to Algolia requests, use the
  * \"Clicked object IDs after search\" event.
  *
  * @param eventName
  *   Can contain up to 64 ASCII characters. Consider naming events consistentlyâ€”for example, by adopting Segment's
  *   [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework)
  *   framework.
  * @param index
  *   Name of the Algolia index.
  * @param objectIDs
  *   List of object identifiers for items of an Algolia index.
  * @param userToken
  *   Anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier. > **Note**: Never include personally identifiable information in user
  *   tokens.
  * @param timestamp
  *   Time of the event in milliseconds in [Unix epoch time](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). By default, the
  *   Insights API uses the time it receives an event as its timestamp.
