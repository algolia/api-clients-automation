  * [SLA](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/) if you use the REST API directly.

  *
  * @param promote
  *   Records to promote.
  * @param filterPromotes
  *   Only use in combination with the `promote` consequence. When `true`, promoted results will be restricted to match
  *   the filters of the current search. When `false`, the promoted results will show up regardless of the filters.
  * @param hide
  *   Records to hide. By default, you can hide up to 50 records per rule.
  * @param userData
  *   Custom JSON object that will be appended to the userData array in the response. This object isn't interpreted by
  *   the API. It's limited to 1kB of minified JSON.
