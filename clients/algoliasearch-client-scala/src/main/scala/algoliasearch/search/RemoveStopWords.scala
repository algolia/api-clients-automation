/** Search API ## Client libraries Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with
  * your apps. The official API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level
  * Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla). For more information, see [Algolia's
  * ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem). ## Base URLs
  * Base URLs for the Search API: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`.
  * If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra), this ensures that
  * requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with
  * load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ## Retry strategy To guarantee high availability, implement a retry
  * strategy for all API requests using the URLs of your servers as fallbacks: -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com` These URLs use a different DNS provider than the primary URLs. Randomize
  * this list to ensure an even load across the three servers. All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy. ##
  * Authentication Add these headers to authenticate requests: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application
  * ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The required access
  * control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and
  * API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Request format Depending on
  * the endpoint, request bodies are either JSON objects or arrays of JSON objects. ## Parameters Parameters are passed
  * as query parameters for GET and DELETE requests, and in the request body for POST and PUT requests. Query parameters
  * must be [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). Non-ASCII characters must
  * be UTF-8 encoded. Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces. Arrays as query parameters must be one of: - A
  * comma-separated string: `attributesToRetrieve=title,description` - A URL-encoded JSON array:
  * `attributesToRetrieve=%5B%22title%22,%22description%22%D` ## Response status and errors The Search API returns JSON
  * responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API
  * response. Successful responses return `2xx` statuses. Client errors return `4xx` statuses. Server errors return
  * `5xx` statuses. Error responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Version The current version of
  * the Search API is version 1, indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
