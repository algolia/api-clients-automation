/** Search API The Algolia Search API lets you search, configure, and manage your indices and records. ## Client
  * libraries Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with your apps. The official
  * API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/). See:
  * [Algolia's ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem/) ##
  * Base URLs The base URLs for requests to the Search API are: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`. If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search
  * Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra), this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both
  * URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Retry strategy To guarantee high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of
  * your servers as fallbacks: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com` These URLs use a different
  * DNS provider than the primary URLs. You should randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers.
  * All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy. ## Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add
  * these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the
  * necessary permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in
  * each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). ## Request format Depending on the endpoint, request bodies are
  * either JSON objects or arrays of JSON objects, ## Parameters Parameters are passed as query parameters for GET and
  * DELETE requests, and in the request body for POST and PUT requests. Query parameters must be
  * [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). Non-ASCII characters must be
  * UTF-8 encoded. Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces. Arrays as query parameters must be one of: - A
  * comma-separated string: `attributesToRetrieve=title,description` - A URL-encoded JSON array:
  * `attributesToRetrieve=%5B%22title%22,%22description%22%D` ## Response status and errors The Search API returns JSON
  * responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API
  * response. Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are
  * indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Version The current
  * version of the Search API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
  *

/** GetApiKeyResponse
  *
  * @param value
  *   API key.
  * @param createdAt
  *   Timestamp when the object was created, in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
  * @param acl
  *   Permissions that determine the type of API requests this key can make. The required ACL is listed in each
  *   endpoint's reference. For more information, see [access control
  *   list](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/#access-control-list-acl).
  * @param description
  *   Description of an API key to help you identify this API key.
  * @param indexes
  *   Index names or patterns that this API key can access. By default, an API key can access all indices in the same
  *   application. You can use leading and trailing wildcard characters (`*`): - `dev_*` matches all indices starting
  *   with \"dev_\". - `*_dev` matches all indices ending with \"_dev\". - `*_products_*` matches all indices containing
  *   \"_products_\".
  * @param maxHitsPerQuery
  *   Maximum number of results this API key can retrieve in one query. By default, there's no limit.
  * @param maxQueriesPerIPPerHour
  *   Maximum number of API requests allowed per IP address or [user
  *   token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken/) per hour. If this limit is reached,
  *   the API returns an error with status code `429`. By default, there's no limit.
  * @param queryParameters
  *   Query parameters to add when making API requests with this API key. To restrict this API key to specific IP
  *   addresses, add the `restrictSources` parameter. You can only add a single source, but you can provide a range of
  *   IP addresses. Creating an API key fails if the request is made from an IP address outside the restricted range.
  * @param referers
  *   Allowed HTTP referrers for this API key. By default, all referrers are allowed. You can use leading and trailing
  *   wildcard characters (`*`): - `https://algolia.com/_*` allows all referrers starting with \"https://algolia.com/\"
  *   \- `*.algolia.com` allows all referrers ending with \".algolia.com\" - `*algolia.com*` allows all referrers in the
  *   domain \"algolia.com\". Like all HTTP headers, referrers can be spoofed. Don't rely on them to secure your data.
  *   For more information, see [HTTP referrer
  *   restrictions](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/security-best-practices/#http-referrers-restrictions).
  * @param validity
  *   Duration (in seconds) after which the API key expires. By default, API keys don't expire.
