/** Search API Use the Search REST API to manage your data (indices and records), implement search, and improve

  * tools](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem/) instead. There's no
  * [SLA](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/) if you use the REST API directly.
