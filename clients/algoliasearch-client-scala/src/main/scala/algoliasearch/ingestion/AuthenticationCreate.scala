/** Ingestion API The Ingestion API lets you connect third-party services and platforms with Algolia and schedule tasks
  * to ingest your data. The Ingestion API powers the no-code [data
  * connectors](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors). # Base URLs The base URLs for making requests to the
  * Ingestion API are: - `https://data.us.algolia.com` - `https://data.eu.algolia.com` Use the URL that matches your
  * [analytics region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All requests must use HTTPS.**
  * # Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add these headers: <dl>
  * <dt><code>x-algolia-application-id</code></dt> <dd>Your Algolia application ID.</dd>
  * <dt><code>x-algolia-api-key</code></dt> <dd> An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The
  * required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. </dd> </dl> You can
  * find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). # Request
  * format Request bodies must be JSON objects. # Response status and errors Response bodies are JSON objects. Deleting
  * a user token returns an empty response body with rate-limiting information as headers. Successful responses return a
  * `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses
  * have a `message` property with more information. The Insights API doesn't validate if the event parameters such as
  * `indexName`, `objectIDs`, or `userToken`, correspond to anything in the Search API. It justs checks if they're
  * formatted correctly. Check the [Events](https://dashboard.algolia.com/events/health) health section, whether your
  * events can be used for Algolia features such as Analytics, or Dynamic Re-Ranking. # Version The current version of
  * the Insights API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
