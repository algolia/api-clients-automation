/** Ingestion API The Ingestion API lets you connect third-party services and platforms with Algolia and schedule tasks
  * to ingest your data. The Ingestion API powers the no-code [data
  * connectors](https://dashboard.algolia.com/connectors). ## Base URLs The base URLs for requests to the Ingestion API
  * are: - `https://data.us.algolia.com` - `https://data.eu.algolia.com` Use the URL that matches your [analytics

  * Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia
  * application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The required
  * access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID
  * and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). ## Request format Request bodies must
  * be JSON objects. ## Response status and errors Response bodies are JSON objects. Successful responses return a `2xx`
  * status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a
  * `message` property with more information. ## Version The current version of the Ingestion API is version 1, as
