/** Object with detailed information about the record's ranking.
  *
  * @param filters
  *   Whether a filter matched the query.
  * @param firstMatchedWord
  *   Position of the first matched word in the best matching attribute of the record.
  * @param geoDistance
  *   Distance between the geo location in the search query and the best matching geo location in the record, divided by
  *   the geo precision (in meters).
  * @param geoPrecision
  *   Precision used when computing the geo distance, in meters.
  * @param nbExactWords
  *   Number of exactly matched words.
  * @param nbTypos
  *   Number of typos encountered when matching the record.
  * @param promoted
  *   Whether the record was promoted by a rule.
  * @param proximityDistance
  *   Number of words between multiple matches in the query plus 1. For single word queries, `proximityDistance` is 0.
  * @param userScore
  *   Overall ranking of the record, expressed as a single integer. This attribute is internal.
  * @param words
  *   Number of matched words.
  * @param promotedByReRanking
