/** Composition API ## Client libraries Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs
  * with your apps. For more information, see [Algolia's
  * ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem). ## Base URLs
  * Base URLs for the Composition API: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`. If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search
  * Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra), this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both
  * URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Retry strategy To guarantee high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of
  * your servers as fallbacks: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com` These URLs use a different
  * DNS provider than the primary URLs. Randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers. All Algolia
  * API clients implement this retry strategy. ## Authentication Add these headers to authenticate requests: -
  * `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary
  * permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each
  * endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Request format Depending on the endpoint, request
  * bodies are either JSON objects or arrays of JSON objects. ## Parameters Parameters are passed in the request body
  * for POST and PUT requests. ## Response status and errors The Composition API returns JSON responses. Since JSON
  * doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response. Successful
  * responses return `2xx` statuses. Client errors return `4xx` statuses. Server errors return `5xx` statuses. Error
  * responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Version The current version of the Composition API is
  * version 1, indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0

/** HitRankingInfo
  *
  * @param filters
  *   Whether a filter matched the query.
  * @param firstMatchedWord
  *   Position of the first matched word in the best matching attribute of the record.
  * @param geoDistance
  *   Distance between the geo location in the search query and the best matching geo location in the record, divided by
  *   the geo precision (in meters).
  * @param geoPrecision
  *   Precision used when computing the geo distance, in meters.
  * @param nbExactWords
  *   Number of exactly matched words.
  * @param nbTypos
  *   Number of typos encountered when matching the record.
  * @param promoted
  *   Whether the record was promoted by a rule.
  * @param proximityDistance
  *   Number of words between multiple matches in the query plus 1. For single word queries, `proximityDistance` is 0.
  * @param userScore
  *   Overall ranking of the record, expressed as a single integer. This attribute is internal.
  * @param words
  *   Number of matched words.
  * @param promotedByReRanking
  *   Whether the record is re-ranked.
