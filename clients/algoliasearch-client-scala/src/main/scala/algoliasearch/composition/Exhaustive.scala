/** Whether certain properties of the search response are calculated exhaustive (exact) or approximated.
  *
  * @param facetsCount
  *   Whether the facet count is exhaustive (`true`) or approximate (`false`). See the [related
  *   discussion](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406975248145-Why-are-my-facet-and-hit-counts-not-accurate-).
  * @param facetValues
  *   The value is `false` if not all facet values are retrieved.
  * @param nbHits
  *   Whether the `nbHits` is exhaustive (`true`) or approximate (`false`). When the query takes more than 50ms to be
  *   processed, the engine makes an approximation. This can happen when using complex filters on millions of records,
  *   when typo-tolerance was not exhaustive, or when enough hits have been retrieved (for example, after the engine
  *   finds 10,000 exact matches). `nbHits` is reported as non-exhaustive whenever an approximation is made, even if the
  *   approximation didn’t, in the end, impact the exhaustivity of the query.
  * @param rulesMatch
  *   Rules matching exhaustivity. The value is `false` if rules were enable for this query, and could not be fully
  *   processed due a timeout. This is generally caused by the number of alternatives (such as typos) which is too
  *   large.
  * @param typo
  *   Whether the typo search was exhaustive (`true`) or approximate (`false`). An approximation is done when the typo
  *   search query part takes more than 10% of the query budget (ie. 5ms by default) to be processed (this can happen
  *   when a lot of typo alternatives exist for the query). This field will not be included when typo-tolerance is
  *   entirely disabled.
