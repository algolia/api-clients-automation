/** Composition API The Algolia Composition API lets you run composed search requests on your Compositions. ## Client
  * libraries Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with your apps. See:
  * [Algolia's ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem/) ##
  * Base URLs The base URLs for requests to the Composition API are: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`. If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search
  * Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra), this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both
  * URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Retry strategy To guarantee high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of
  * your servers as fallbacks: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com` These URLs use a different
  * DNS provider than the primary URLs. You should randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers.
  * All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy. ## Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add
  * these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the
  * necessary permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in
  * each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). ## Request format Depending on the endpoint, request bodies are
  * either JSON objects or arrays of JSON objects, ## Parameters Parameters are passed in the request body for POST and
  * PUT requests. Query parameters must be
  * [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). Non-ASCII characters must be
  * UTF-8 encoded. Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces. ## Response status and errors The Composition API
  * returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in
  * the API response. Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are
  * indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Version The current
  * version of the Composition API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0

/** Condition
  *
  * @param pattern
  *   Query pattern that triggers the rule. You can use either a literal string, or a special pattern
  *   `{facet:ATTRIBUTE}`, where `ATTRIBUTE` is a facet name. The rule is triggered if the query matches the literal
  *   string or a value of the specified facet. For example, with `pattern: {facet:genre}`, the rule is triggered when
  *   users search for a genre, such as \"comedy\".
  * @param context
  *   An additional restriction that only triggers the rule, when the search has the same value as `ruleContexts`
  *   parameter. For example, if `context: mobile`, the rule is only triggered when the search request has a matching
  *   `ruleContexts: mobile`. A rule context must only contain alphanumeric characters.
  * @param filters
  *   Filters that trigger the rule. You can add add filters using the syntax `facet:value` so that the rule is
  *   triggered, when the specific filter is selected. You can use `filters` on its own or combine it with the `pattern`
  *   parameter.
