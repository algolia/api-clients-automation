/** Composition API The Algolia Composition API lets you run composed search requests on your Compositions. ## Client
  * libraries Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with your apps. See:
  * [Algolia's ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem) ##
  * Base URLs The base URLs for requests to the Composition API are: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`. If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search
  * Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra), this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users. Both
  * URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing. **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Retry strategy To guarantee high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of
  * your servers as fallbacks: - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com` -
  * `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com` - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com` These URLs use a different
  * DNS provider than the primary URLs. You should randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers.
  * All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy. ## Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add
  * these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the
  * necessary permissions to make the request. The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in
  * each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account). ## Request format Depending on the endpoint, request bodies are
  * either JSON objects or arrays of JSON objects, ## Parameters Parameters are passed in the request body for POST and
  * PUT requests. Query parameters must be
  * [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). Non-ASCII characters must be
  * UTF-8 encoded. Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces. ## Response status and errors The Composition API
  * returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in
  * the API response. Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are
  * indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Version The current
  * version of the Composition API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0

/** Params
  *
  * @param query
  *   Search query.
  * @param filters
  *   Filter expression to only include items that match the filter criteria in the response. You can use these filter
  *   expressions: - **Numeric filters.** `<facet> <op> <number>`, where `<op>` is one of `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`,
  *   `>=`. - **Ranges.** `<facet>:<lower> TO <upper>` where `<lower>` and `<upper>` are the lower and upper limits of
  *   the range (inclusive). - **Facet filters.** `<facet>:<value>` where `<facet>` is a facet attribute
  *   (case-sensitive) and `<value>` a facet value. - **Tag filters.** `_tags:<value>` or just `<value>`
  *   (case-sensitive). - **Boolean filters.** `<facet>: true | false`. You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and
  *   `NOT` operators with the following restrictions: - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`. **Not
  *   supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`. - You can't use `NOT` with combinations of filters. **Not supported:**
  *   `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)` - You can't combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`. **Not supported:**
  *   `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)` Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or
  *   facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes. If a facet attribute is an array, the filter
  *   matches if it matches at least one element of the array. For more information, see
  *   [Filters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering).
  * @param page
  *   Page of search results to retrieve.
  * @param getRankingInfo
  *   Whether the run response should include detailed ranking information.
  * @param relevancyStrictness
  *   Relevancy threshold below which less relevant results aren't included in the results You can only set
  *   `relevancyStrictness` on [virtual replica
  *   indices](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/in-depth/replicas/#what-are-virtual-replicas).
  *   Use this setting to strike a balance between the relevance and number of returned results.
  * @param hitsPerPage
  *   Number of hits per page.
  * @param aroundLatLng
  *   Coordinates for the center of a circle, expressed as a comma-separated string of latitude and longitude. Only
  *   records included within a circle around this central location are included in the results. The radius of the
  *   circle is determined by the `aroundRadius` and `minimumAroundRadius` settings. This parameter is ignored if you
  *   also specify `insidePolygon` or `insideBoundingBox`.
  * @param aroundLatLngViaIP
  *   Whether to obtain the coordinates from the request's IP address.
  * @param minimumAroundRadius
  *   Minimum radius (in meters) for a search around a location when `aroundRadius` isn't set.
  * @param insidePolygon
  *   Coordinates of a polygon in which to search. Polygons are defined by 3 to 10,000 points. Each point is represented
  *   by its latitude and longitude. Provide multiple polygons as nested arrays. For more information, see [filtering
  *   inside
  *   polygons](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/geolocation/#filtering-inside-rectangular-or-polygonal-areas).
  *   This parameter is ignored if you also specify `insideBoundingBox`.
  * @param queryLanguages
  *   Languages for language-specific query processing steps such as plurals, stop-word removal, and word-detection
  *   dictionaries This setting sets a default list of languages used by the `removeStopWords` and `ignorePlurals`
  *   settings. This setting also sets a dictionary for word detection in the logogram-based
  *   [CJK](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/normalization/#normalization-for-logogram-based-languages-cjk)
  *   languages. To support this, you must place the CJK language **first** **You should always specify a query
  *   language.** If you don't specify an indexing language, the search engine uses all [supported
  *   languages](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/supported-languages),
  *   or the languages you specified with the `ignorePlurals` or `removeStopWords` parameters. This can lead to
  *   unexpected search results. For more information, see [Language-specific
  *   configuration](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/language-specific-configurations).
  * @param naturalLanguages
  *   ISO language codes that adjust settings that are useful for processing natural language queries (as opposed to
  *   keyword searches) - Sets `removeStopWords` and `ignorePlurals` to the list of provided languages. - Sets
  *   `removeWordsIfNoResults` to `allOptional`. - Adds a `natural_language` attribute to `ruleContexts` and
  *   `analyticsTags`.
  * @param enableRules
  *   Whether to enable composition rules.
  * @param ruleContexts
  *   Assigns a rule context to the run query [Rule
  *   contexts](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/rules/rules-overview/how-to/customize-search-results-by-platform/#whats-a-context)
  *   are strings that you can use to trigger matching rules.
  * @param userToken
  *   Unique pseudonymous or anonymous user identifier. This helps with analytics and click and conversion events. For
  *   more information, see [user token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
  * @param clickAnalytics
  *   Whether to include a `queryID` attribute in the response The query ID is a unique identifier for a search query
  *   and is required for tracking [click and conversion
  *   events](https://www.algolia.com/guides/sending-events/getting-started).
  * @param analytics
  *   Whether this search will be included in Analytics.
  * @param analyticsTags
  *   Tags to apply to the query for [segmenting analytics
  *   data](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/search-analytics/guides/segments).
  * @param enableABTest
  *   Whether to enable index level A/B testing for this run request. If the composition mixes multiple indices, the A/B
  *   test is ignored.
  * @param enableReRanking
  *   Whether this search will use [Dynamic Re-Ranking](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/algolia-ai/re-ranking) This
  *   setting only has an effect if you activated Dynamic Re-Ranking for this index in the Algolia dashboard.
  * @param injectedItems
  *   A list of extenrally injected objectID groups into from an external source.
