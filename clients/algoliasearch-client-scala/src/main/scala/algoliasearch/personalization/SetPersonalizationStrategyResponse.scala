/** Personalization API ## Base URLs Base URLs for the Personalization API: - `https://personalization.us.algolia.com` -
  * `https://personalization.eu.algolia.com` Use the URL that matches your [analytics
  * region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Authentication Add these headers to authenticate requests: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application
  * ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The required access
  * control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID and
  * API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Request format Request bodies
  * must be JSON objects. ## Response status and errors The Personalization API returns JSON responses. Since JSON
  * doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response. Successful
  * responses return `2xx` statuses. Client errors return `4xx` statuses. Server errors return `5xx` statuses. Error
  * responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Rate limiting When making requests to the
  * Personalization API, you are limited to 40 API calls per second per application. The following headers provide
  * information about your current limit: - `x-ratelimit-limit`: The number of requests allowed every second. -
  * `x-ratelimit-remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current second period. - `x-ratelimit-reset`:
  * Timestamp when the next time period starts, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch. ## Version The current version
  * of the Personalization API is version 1, indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
