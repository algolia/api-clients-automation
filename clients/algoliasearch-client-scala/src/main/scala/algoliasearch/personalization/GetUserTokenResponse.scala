/** Personalization API The Personalization API lets you access user profiles built from the personalization strategy.
  * ## Base URLs The base URLs for requests to the Personalization API are: - `https://personalization.us.algolia.com` -
  * `https://personalization.eu.algolia.com` Use the URL that matches your [analytics
  * region](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/infrastructure/analytics). **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Authentication To authenticate your API requests, add these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia
  * application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request. The required
  * access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference. You can find your application ID
  * and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). ## Request format Request
  * bodies must be JSON objects. ## Response status and errors The Personalization API returns JSON responses. Since
  * JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response. Successful
  * responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.
  * Error responses have a `message` property with more information. ## Rate limiting When making requests to the
  * Personalization API, you are limited to 40 API calls per second per application. The following headers provide
  * information about your current limit: - `x-ratelimit-limit`: The number of requests allowed every second. -
  * `x-ratelimit-remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current second period. - `x-ratelimit-reset`: [Unix
  * timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com) of the next time period. ## Version The current version of the
  * Personalization API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
