/** Algolia Monitoring API The Monitoring API lets you check the status of your Algolia infrastructure. ## Base URLs The
  * base URL for requests to the Monitoring API is: - `https://status.algolia.com` **All requests must use HTTPS.** ##
  * Availability and authentication Access to the Infrastructure endpoints is available as part of the [Premium or
  * Elevate plans](https://www.algolia.com/pricing). To authenticate requests to the Infrastructure endpoints, add these
  * headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. Your Monitoring API key.
  * You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). Other endpoints don't require authentication. ##
  * Response status and errors The Monitoring API returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific
  * ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response. Successful responses return a `2xx` status.
  * Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status. Error responses have a `message`
  * property with more information. ## Version The current version of the Monitoring API is version 1, as indicated by
  * the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
