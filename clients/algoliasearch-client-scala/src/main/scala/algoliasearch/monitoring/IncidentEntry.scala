/** Algolia Monitoring API ## Base URLs Base URL for the Monitoring API: - `https://status.algolia.com` **All requests
  * must use HTTPS.** ## Availability and authentication Access to the Infrastructure endpoints is available as part of
  * the [Premium or Elevate plans](https://www.algolia.com/pricing). To authenticate requests to the Infrastructure
  * endpoints, add these headers: - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID. - `x-algolia-api-key`. Your
  * Monitoring API key. You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia
  * dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys). Other endpoints don't require authentication. ##
  * Response status and errors The Monitoring API returns JSON responses. Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific
  * ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response. Successful responses return `2xx` statuses.
  * Client errors return `4xx` statuses. Server errors return `5xx` statuses. Error responses have a `message` property
  * with more information. ## Version The current version of the Monitoring API is version 1, indicated by the `/1/` in
  * each endpoint's URL.
  *
  * The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
