/*
 * Search API
 *
 * Use the Search REST API  to manage your data (indices and records), implement search, and improve relevance (with Rules, synonyms, and language dictionaries).  Although Algolia provides a REST API, you should use the official open source API [clients, libraries, and tools](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem/) instead. There's no [SLA](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/) if you use the REST API directly.
